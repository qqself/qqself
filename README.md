# Achieving mastery takes decades - how to keep going?

Very few succeed in reaching mastery, and most give up along this lifelong journey. Why does motivation disappear after just a few lessons with your new musical instrument or gym visits? Why do we go strong for multiple years and one day just abandon something that constantly was giving us joy? You can become a master at anything, and the only way to fail is to give up.

There are a lot of amazing books about how to achieve mastery, interviews with top masters, and papers about long-term motivation. Based on them, we've created a learning system and an app to give you the tools to support your lifetime journey.

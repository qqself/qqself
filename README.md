Personal tracking system to support long term skill development:

- Universal language to support tracking of almost any kind of data
- Local first - all data stored on the client
- End-to-end encryption synchronization - data is encrypted on a client before sending
- Shared core Rust library with all the logic e.g. parsing/encryption with Web-Assembly support
- Multiple experimental frontends - CLI/PWA and the one with gamification elements

## Research about long-term skill development

Do you know a good book/paper/article/research about long-term skill development:

- How to achieve mastery?
- What causes us to give up, what helps us keep pushing and continue?
- How to start learning new skill, overcome fear?
- How to live through plateau, when no progress is visible?

Have a look what we have in [library.md](research/library.md) and create PR with your suggestions. Thank you!

# Achieving mastery takes decades - how to keep going?

qqself is a `Mastering System`: a comprehensive overview of long-term skill development. It seeks to answer the main question, "Why do we give up?" and explores what helps us to keep going. There are numerous books about skill development and interviews with top-of-the-field masters, and this book incorporates wisdom from those sources.

qqself is also an app, interactive journal that uses all the techniques and strategies from the `Mastering System`.

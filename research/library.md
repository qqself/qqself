[Expert In A Year](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Year-Ultimate-Tennis-Challenge-ebook/dp/B0142TUYE6)

- 2000-3000 hours are needed to get to the top 1% of the field
- Camps may be highly effective - practicing whole days with the help of couches, dedicating all the time and energy to learning
- Camps/Competitions - surrounding yourself with people better than you. You'll learn from them, you'll implicitly repeat after them, learning good habits and practices from them
- So much of success comes down to not quitting - simply continuing to practice and improve over the long-term
- Challenge - rather than practice X hours of Y, it's better to set a specific target. Risk is high chance of giving up entirely on a whole thing if we set a particular challenge which we fail
- Couches - even 1 hour per week can make a big difference
- If training/practice is super hard, we are not going to be consistent with the schedule

[The Long Game](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Game-Long-Term-Thinker-Short-Term-ebook/dp/B08TCHGQ1G)

- Opportunity cost - It's not about watching a movie or not. It's watching a movie OR doing something else. The cost of not doing this is often invisible.
- How would we feel about this missing opportunity/or accepted one in a year? How would we think about this summer, about the whole year, about this Friday?
- Ridiculous goals are ridiculous right now, not forever. Where can I go from here? If we start with this question, we limit ourselves to what we currently have and a bit more on top. The better approach is to set the goal that is so far reached that it has almost no connection to reality and then figuring out all the things that are necessary for achieving that
- With some skills, most of the time you spend on the plateau - there is no other way
- To keep pushing: Why am I doing this? Whom do I want to be in the world? Keep the vision close and revisit it when you fell demotivated to continue
- We have to put a date on it: Without the infinite stream of new urgent things going to delay it indefinitely
- If we reach every goal we set - we are probably aiming too low
- Public commitment - promise to reach the goal to someone, promise to report on this specific date whether you've achieved it or not
- The key is getting started - we need to make it as easy as possible, 1 minute, 1 second, open the book, read the title, open the file, go outside. Starting is the blocker - get rid of it

[Deliberate Practice and Performance in Music, Games, Sports, Education, and Professions: A Meta-Analysis](https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/76260)

- Difference in hours spent on deliberate practice stops playing an important role when comparing top performant athletes, e.g., Olympic level. Difference still holds on sub-elite groups (local/state level). The importance of deliberate practice diminishes at high levels of expertise in music as well
- Most impactful activities for improving performance:
    1. Practice alone
    2. Taking lessons
    3. Solo performance
    4. Teacher-designed practice
- Average hours of practice per week: 22h best players; 30h good players; 10 average players.
- Best players spent even less time on practice compared to good ones, so it's not only about time
- Both best and good groups spent significantly more time than the average group. Time spent is still a very a good indicator of the progress

[Deliberate Practice and Proposed Limits on the Effects of Practice on the Acquisition of Expert Performance: Why the Original Definition Matters and Recommendations for Future Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02396/full)
- One of the essential parts of deliberate practice is - Desire to improve the performance and immediate feedback about the result
- Teacher lessons may be just an hour per week, but often teacher designs practice activities that students will practice on its own
- 4 main concepts
    1. Individualised training created by a well-qualified teacher
    2. Teacher should communicate the specific goal for the student
    3. Teacher describes the activity that allows the student to get immediate feedback
    4. Students can make repeated attempts to approach the desired goal
- It takes 1,612 to 14,196 hours of solitary practice to reach the level of chess master. Roughly 1% of top of the tournament players in a given country
- It's not a rule, but there is a correlation between hours of deliberate practice aimed at improving some specific aspects of performance and overall skill level

[How Many Hours Of Chess Study Does It Take To Be A Grandmaster?](https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-grandmaster-hours)

- Burnout affect after 20 hours of study per week
- Estimated time to become a Grand Master - 12,480 hours

[Complexity and the Ten-Thousand-Hour Rule](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule)

- It takes a lot of practice and learning to master the complex skill
- 10'000 hours - A rough estimate of the average amount of time for an average person to sufficiently master a complex
  skill using deliberate practice
- Some outliers makes it to the top faster, as well as people for whom it took longer
- It's not a magic number but a reasonable estimate that shows that reaching mastery is a long way

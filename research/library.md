- 2000-3000 hours needed to get to the top 1% of the field
- Camps may be extremely effective - practicing whole days with the help of couches, dedicating all the time and energy
  to learning
- Camps/Competitions - surrounding yourself with people better than you. You'll learn from them, you'll
  implicitly repeat after them, learning good habits and practices from them
- So much of success comes down to not quitting - simply continuing to practice and improve over the long-term
- Challenge - rather than practice X hours of Y it's better to set a specific target. Risk is high chance of giving up
  completely on a whole thing if we set a certain challenge which we fail
- Couches - even 1 hour per week can make a big difference
- If training/practice is super hard we are not going to be consistent with the schedule

- Opportunity cost - It's not about watching a movie or not, it's watching a movie OR doing something else.
  Cost of not doing this is often invisible
- In a year - this missing opportunity/or accepted one - how would we feel about it? How would we feel about this
  summer, about whole year, about this Friday?
- Ridiculous goals are ridiculous right now, not forever. Where can I go from here? If we start with this question then
  we very much limit ourselves to what we currently have and a bit more on top. Better approach is to set the goal that
  is so far reached, that has almost no connection to the reality and then figuring out all the things that are
  necessary for achieving that
- With some skills most of the time you spend on the plateau - there is no other way
- To keep pushing: Why am I doing this? This is who I want to be in the world? Keep the vision close and revisit it when
  you fell demotivated to continue
- We have to put a date on it: Without the infinite stream of new urgent things going to delay it indefinitely
- If we reach every goal we set - we are probably aiming too low
- Public commitment - promise to reach the goal to someone, promise to report on this specific date whether you've
  achieved it or not
- The key is getting started - we need to make it as easy as possible, 1 minute, 1 second, open the book, read the
  title, open the file, go outside. Starting is the blocker - get rid of it

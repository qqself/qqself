# Library

Set of sources about long-term skill development with small notes about ideas we may use in `qqself`. Notes are mostly for things that can be used in our apps, those books are much more than that and I recommend to read it fully.

## Books

### Peak

Anders Ericsson
https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS

- Once we reach an "acceptable" performance and automaticity level, the additional years of "practice" don't lead to improvement. Playing the same song for 10'000 hours would bring stagnation, not improvement
- Just doing it doesn't improve the skill. Purposeful practice is:
  - Has a well-defined, specific goal
  - Is focused
  - Involves feedback
  - Getting out of comfort zone
- Positive, meaningful feedback is crucial for maintaining motivation. Internal like satisfaction from improvement, or externally provided by others
- The best way to learn is to be guided by the teacher. If not available, the next would be to study the work of experts and try to reproduce it
- Encountering plateau is typical in many skills. When we hit it, we think we've reached some limit, and we stop trying to move forward and stop improving
- To find your weakest point that limits you and creates a plateau, push things a little and make it harder than usual. See where mistakes are coming from and what breaks down first. Then design a practice technique aiming an improving that particular weakness
- Maintaining motivation to keep practicing has two parts: Reasons to keep going and reasons to stop. When we quit, it means the reasons to stop outweigh the reasons to continue. To continue either strengthen reason to keep going or weaken reasons to quit
- Reasons to continue: Fixed time to practice; Good planning; Desire to become better; Get pride from your identity change. Believe that you can succeed. Find what interferes with training and find a way to minimize it.
- Surround yourself with people who will encourage, support, and challenge you in your endeavors. Who appreciate your passion and understand it
- Arbitrary levels of achievements - split big goals into much smaller ones to keep you motivated. Count the number of errors, successes, kilometers, seconds, hits, etc.
- Once you reach an advanced level in one domain, you understand what it takes to reach such levels in other domains.

### Ultralearning

Scott Young https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate-ebook/dp/B07K6MF8MD

- In the beginning, when we have no ideas how to start learning of a new skill consider fields experts. Check who the best in the field and what they suggest as a recommended way to learn
- Focus is an ability on it's own that helps dramatically in learning
- The first step of fighting procrastination is acknowledging that
- Starting often is a problem. We can simplify it by doing an activity for 5 minutes and then we can rest
- Pomodoro for 25 minutes, just start it and then either do an activity or do nothing, it all counts
- Sometimes our own mind is a obstacle that prevents us from focusing learning. Meditation is one way of getting calm back
- There are different kinds of focus - for some tasks total silence of a library is needed, for others coffee shop would work better
- Directness - learning things closely to the situation or context you want to use it in. Learning the full song vs practicing different exercises; speaking the language vs using the fun app; Much of learning takes place while doing the thing you want to become good at. We don't want to become good at doing artificial, perfect exercises
- Directness could be achieved by:
  - Doing projects - playing a whole song
  - Immersion - jumping full in in the environment, like moving to the country for language learning
  - Simulation - flight simulator
  - Overkill - increasing the challenge, like signing up for 160km running race
- Work on your weakest points - often those are limiting factors. Doing bunch of exercises for that will be tough, but will give the most results
- While directness covers the whole range of applying the skill, drills are about practicing isolated part of it. Such practice allows to focus on only one thing and work on improving that in isolation. Both approaches should be used and neither should be ignored
- Drills differs from other artificial exercises that it should attack our weakest point: Doing it should be uncomfortable, tough and slow, but we have to be confident why we are doing it, that it's sub-skill that limits us in target skill development. Choice of drills directed by the student
- Free recall - just trying to remember what you've learned is an effective learning method
- People tend to measure learning results based on how smooth and fluently was a learning experience e.g. reading notes is a way easier than trying to recall all the things we wrote. If we struggle during learning we think we didn't learn it yet.
- Forward-testing effect - taking the test before learning has started may improve it. Such testing may reinforce searching strategies that will be used once knowledge is there. It may also help you later to spot the solution and relate your new knowledge to the problem you've seen
- While directness approach works best, passive exposure to skill related technics, practices and methods is still needed: We can't apply it, if we don't know about it.
- Common feeling is absence of time. In reality there are a lot of wasted time. Have a time log for a few days and see how much time is actually wasted

### Expert In A Year

Sam Priestley
https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Year-Ultimate-Tennis-Challenge-ebook/dp/B0142TUYE6

- 2000-3000 hours are needed to get to the top 1% of the field
- Camps may be highly effective - practicing whole days with the help of couches, dedicating all the time and energy to learning
- Camps/Competitions - surrounding yourself with people better than you. You'll learn from them, you'll implicitly repeat after them, learning good habits and practices from them
- So much of success comes down to not quitting - simply continuing to practice and improve over the long-term
- Challenge - rather than practice X hours of Y, it's better to set a specific target. Risk is high chance of giving up entirely on a whole thing if we set a particular challenge which we fail
- Couches - even 1 hour per week can make a big difference
- If training/practice is super hard, we are not going to be consistent with the schedule

### The Long Game

Dorie Clark
https://www.amazon.com/Long-Game-Long-Term-Thinker-Short-Term-ebook/dp/B08TCHGQ1G

- Opportunity cost - It's not about watching a movie or not. It's watching a movie OR doing something else. The cost of not doing this is often invisible.
- How would we feel about this missing opportunity/or accepted one in a year? How would we think about this summer, about the whole year, about this Friday?
- Ridiculous goals are ridiculous right now, not forever. Where can I go from here? If we start with this question, we limit ourselves to what we currently have and a bit more on top. The better approach is to set the goal that is so far reached that it has almost no connection to reality and then figuring out all the things that are necessary for achieving that
- With some skills, most of the time you spend on the plateau - there is no other way
- To keep pushing: Why am I doing this? Whom do I want to be in the world? Keep the vision close and revisit it when you fell demotivated to continue
- We have to put a date on it: Without the infinite stream of new urgent things going to delay it indefinitely
- If we reach every goal we set - we are probably aiming too low
- Public commitment - promise to reach the goal to someone, promise to report on this specific date whether you've achieved it or not
- The key is getting started - we need to make it as easy as possible, 1 minute, 1 second, open the book, read the title, open the file, go outside. Starting is the blocker - get rid of it

### Atomic Habits

James Clear
https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break-ebook/dp/B01N5AX61W

- Goals are excellent, but systems are better: concentrate on how we practice, learn, and progress rather than on a single result, on a single goal that we may fail to achieve
- Bad habits, no matter how small, accumulates over time
- Building habits focusing on what we want to achieve often fails. Focus on who you want to become instead
- The behavior change is identity change: It's not about learning an instrument; the goal is to become a musician

### Deliberate Practice and Performance in Music, Games, Sports, Education, and Professions: A Meta-Analysis

https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/76260

- Difference in hours spent on deliberate practice stops playing an important role when comparing top performant athletes, e.g., Olympic level. Difference still holds on sub-elite groups (local/state level). The importance of deliberate practice diminishes at high levels of expertise in music as well
- Most impactful activities for improving performance:
  1. Practice alone
  2. Taking lessons
  3. Solo performance
  4. Teacher-designed practice
- Average hours of practice per week: 22h best players; 30h good players; 10 average players.
- Best players spent even less time on practice compared to good ones, so it's not only about time
- Both best and good groups spent significantly more time than the average group. Time spent is still a very a good indicator of the progress

### Deliberate Practice and Proposed Limits on the Effects of Practice on the Acquisition of Expert Performance: Why the Original Definition Matters and Recommendations for Future Research

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02396/full

- One of the essential parts of deliberate practice is - Desire to improve the performance and immediate feedback about the result
- Teacher lessons may be just an hour per week, but often teacher designs practice activities that students will practice on its own
- 4 main concepts
  1. Individualised training created by a well-qualified teacher
  2. Teacher should communicate the specific goal for the student
  3. Teacher describes the activity that allows the student to get immediate feedback
  4. Students can make repeated attempts to approach the desired goal
- It takes 1,612 to 14,196 hours of solitary practice to reach the level of chess master. Roughly 1% of top of the tournament players in a given country
- It's not a rule, but there is a correlation between hours of deliberate practice aimed at improving some specific aspects of performance and overall skill level

## Articles

### How Many Hours Of Chess Study Does It Take To Be A Grandmaster?

https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-grandmaster-hours

- Burnout affect after 20 hours of study per week
- Estimated time to become a Grand Master - 12,480 hours

### Complexity and the Ten-Thousand-Hour Rule

https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule

- It takes a lot of practice and learning to master the complex skill
- 10'000 hours - A rough estimate of the average amount of time for an average person to sufficiently master a complex
  skill using deliberate practice
- Some outliers makes it to the top faster, as well as people for whom it took longer
- It's not a magic number but a reasonable estimate that shows that reaching mastery is a long way

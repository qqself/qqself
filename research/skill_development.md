# Skill Development

Long term skill development - how to master something that requires 10-20 years of learning and practicing?

## Problem

Talking about skill development that takes tens of years to master there is only one main problem - not to give up. With
such long way to the top we would face a lot of perfect opportunities to abandon the whole idea. Some skills require
hundreds of
hours to be invested before you can see any results. To make things harder - those results would be not impressive at
all. With almost every skill you spend most time on plateau, without any kind of felling of the progress. With other
skills we may give up even before we've tried it because of our assumption that it's impossible for us to achieve.

How can we become person, that we would like to become?

Essentially there is only one single answer - we just keep practicing and learning and after few thousands of hours we
are done. Unfortunately there is no other way and no one had come up with any other better idea. On the other hand
people had invented a lot of different practices and methods to help overcome short-term difficulties. If we, by using
those technics, would be able to overcome the main issue of giving up, to fight through, to recover and continue out
journey then eventually we will reach a success

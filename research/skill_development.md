# Long-Term Skill Development
Long-term skill development - how to master something that requires 10-20 years of learning and practicing?

## Why is it hard to become a master?
Talking about skill development that takes tens of years to master, there is only one main problem - not to give up. With such a long way to the top, we would face a lot of perfect opportunities to abandon the whole idea. Some skills require hundreds of hours to invest before you can see any results. To make things harder - those results would be not
impressive at all. With almost every skill, you spend the most time on a plateau without feeling progress. With other skills, we may give up even before we've tried it because we assume we can't achieve it.

How can we become the person that we would like to become?

Essentially there is only one answer - we keep practicing and learning, and after a few thousands of hours, we are done. Unfortunately, there is no other way, and no one has come up with any better idea. On the other hand, people have invented a lot of different practices and methods to help overcome short-term difficulties. Using those technics, we could overcome the main issue of giving up, help us in the lowest point, fight through, recover and continue the journey. Then eventually, we will reach success.

## Giving up before
People tend to underestimate what can be achieved in the long term. When we make our goals, we attach them to the current state of things; we estimate what we will be able to do in 10 years based on what we can do right now. It's almost impossible even to imagine ourselves becoming a sculptor, directing a movie, or having a crowd singing your song at a concert if we have never done something like that before. 

In reality, we could achieve a lot in 10-20 years. With 5 hours a week, you'll get to 5000 hours of practice, which is enough to reach advanced levels in many skills. Talent plays a significant role in becoming top of the field, but reaching the top 1% is very much doable with the right level of dedication and right practices.

Another problem is that we have the least amount of information before we start. It's the most unclear situation, it couldn't be worse than that, and there are no ideas where to begin.

## Giving up after the start
In the beginning, we may feel the excitement - "It's a beginning of a journey. Soon, I'll become a master!" As we start from zero, almost every minute of practicing improves our skills; we see the progress and the results. It's a beautiful time, but soon you'll start noticing that progress is slowing down. You become aware of all the things you are missing and the things you need to practice and learn. You'll realize how long, challenging, and difficult the journey of becoming a master will be. You'll feel more distant from achieving mastery after you've invested some time in learning than you thought before starting it when you knew nothing. You become aware of the skill's complexity and may think it's impossible to master it. 

With some skills, the excitement period may be as short as unboxing time. You may have a dream to make music. Still, unfortunately, with many musical instruments, you will not make any music for a very long time. In the beginning, practice will contain many exercises and lessons that are hardly similar to your favorite song you hope to play one day.

## Giving up because the whole thing is stupid!!!111
Learning is tough. Sometimes it's physically exhausting, and your body reaches its limit, and you can't continue. But much more often, toughness is mental, caused by an infinite flow of errors, mistakes, and failures. It's an essence of learning - we start with something we can't do, and through exercise and practice, we acquire a new skill.

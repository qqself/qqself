## Mastering system

`Mastering System` is a comprehensive overview of long-term skill development. It seeks to answer the main question: `Why do we give up?` and explores what helps us to keep going. There are numerous books about skill development and interviews with top-of-the-field masters, and this book incorporates wisdom from those. What sets this book apart, is not only the description of the system but also an app that utilizes all the information from the book.

You can use this book on its own and simply apply advices and strategies in your daily life, or you can give [qqself](https://www.qqself.com/) a try.

# Preface

All my life, I've hated running because I was terrible at it, but here I am finishing my very first 100 kilometers ultra-running race. I can barely walk, and the whole event feels more like ultra-crawling. I didn't expect what it would be, and I made all the possible mistakes. If someone were to tell you that ultra-running is a fun adventure full of joy, then it's a lie - it's about discomfort, pain, and suffering.

There is no joy in it. You can feel it only in the very first 10 minutes of the run when you start. And then after you cross the finish line. And then for about a week, even when you can still barely move, every moment of your existence is filled with a feeling of accomplishment and pure happiness. And then, any time you remember that race, you feel proud, knowing what you've achieved.

Reaching mastery in any skill is a long journey with thousands of hours of exhausting practice near your limits, which is far away from being called joyful. We are happy to do that because of what it brings us - a feeling of getting better, a feeling of accomplishment, and the ability to do what was impossible before.

Every skill, every master, and every scholar are unique, yet there are common reasons why novices give up just after they've started. There is a common issue of plateau when you seem to be no longer progressing, and many more issues that arise in front of everyone on the way to mastery of every skill. 

There are numerous books and reports from the best masters that we can learn from - what strategies musicians use to perfect their skill; what strategies writers use to focus on their work and avoid distraction of the daily life; what keeps us motivated and how to deal with the failures. All the is the `Mastering System`.

## Identities

If you Google "How to write a book?" you'll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps.

Our daily life is full of choices, and having an identity helps us to choose. Being a sculptor is not only about spending time handling clay in your hands—it's also about learning how to see things, noticing beauty (or horrors and creepiness for some of us) in existing art. If you are a writer, then planning to spend a Friday evening in the library sounds great because that's what writers do. Being a drummer means listening to music becomes an active experience where you carefully listen to how drums are used in the song. Identities guide us in the right directions and keep us aligned with long-term goals.

It's almost impossible to fail at an identity. If you are a runner but didn't run for half of the year because of an injury, you are still a runner. If you just wrote your first 10 pages, you are a writer -not a good one yet, but a writer on the way to become better.

Identities work much better in the long run. Compare it to the common New Year resolution: Some may decide to write one page every day, but then life happens, and one day is lost. The plan has failed; it's not every day anymore, and giving up on the whole idea becomes a possibility.

Reaching mastery is always full of terrible mistakes and wrong turns. You may be playing the piano for a long time and one day realize that you have the wrong hand posture. Or doing sculpture and realizing that progress is impossible unless you spend a lot of time learning human anatomy. These may become the lowest points where you are demotivated, lost, and hopeless. Having an identity helps in such cases—it's like a compass that shows you a direction. You would still need time to bypass a sudden obstacle, but it will ensure you get back on track.

Decide who you want to become, write it down, and put it somewhere where you will see it many times a day. Sometimes it's best to put it somewhere where no one else can see it. It's hard to write "Iron Man Triathlete" if you've been a couch potato all your life and afraid that people may laugh at it. Hide it for now; it's temporary, and one day you'll wear those Iron Man cap, bag, and other swag on a daily basis, showing others who you've become.

## Failures

Failures are the main reason why we give up. It could be just in the beginning where we start learning new skill with high expectations only to be crushed by the it's difficulty. Or when you become good at it, after years of practice, realising that it's impossible to be as good as masters. 

Failures is like a cruel teacher that punishes you when you make mistake and fills us with doubt about our ability to continue. It might seem like a curse to have a teacher like that, but despite its archaic methods, its goal is to teach you. 

Failures are just pointers to our weakest points: To some part of our skill that needs correction or enhancement. To the part or our skill that limits us, something which, when improved, will allow us to reach a new level and unlock capabilities that wasn't possible before.

To learn the lesson, there is one thing we need to do: to reflect on it. What exactly had happened and what mistakes did we make? What exactly is the weakest point that surfaced and caused the failure? Write it all down, think about your failure and by doing it you'll grow.

In qqself you have a journal where you write about you skill practices and can reflect about it: Comment how did you feel during a training, what exactly you've practiced or analyse what kind of mistakes did you do which requires attention.

Failures also come in the form of broken plans. They could arise from mistakes due to our lack of skill, but mistakes could also be hidden within the plan itself.

Everyone who starts an ultra-running race has a plan. These races could last up to 40 hours, presenting numerous opportunities for things to go wrong, not in accordance with the plan. Realizing that you are 3 hours behind your intended schedule will crush your motivation and likely make you to give up. A common strategy is to have three plans.

The first plan assumes perfect execution—when you are performing at your best, pushing the boundaries of your capabilities, and achieving a new personal best. Since our brains tend to overestimate, the very first plan that comes to mind is usually this ideal one. When we imagine the outcomes of a new project or challenge, we often assume perfect execution. Don't fight against this; instead, accept it and make it explicit that this plan is for when luck is on your side and everything goes perfectly.

The second plan accepts imperfections. There will be unpleasant surprises, unexpected turns, things will be harder that what you've expected, and moments when your performance falls short of your previous best.

Third plan is when you left you luck at home. It's for situations when the weather is at its worst, the terrain is terrible, and your body refuses to cooperate. Generally, third plan is simply about crossing a finish line.

Having three plans addresses the issue of a wrong expectations and overestimation. This approach keeps your goals more aligned with reality. When you fail to achieve your objectives according to the first plan, it doesn't mean total failure; you've just failed of executing it perfectly. You can then shift to the second plan and keep going. Often, things will align with the second plan. However, there are times when misfortune persists and mistakes continue to happen. This is when the third plan comes into play—when conditions are terrible, yet you persist in reaching the finish line no matter what.

# Preface

I met her at the 86th kilometer of my first 100 km ultra-running race. I could barely walk, and every step was nothing but pain. As she passed me, she asked, `How's it going?` — something I had heard many times in the last 18 hours, but this time it was different. I was amazed at how happy she looked: her smile, her eyes full of joy. Maybe it was the evening sun and the moving clouds, but I think I saw her glowing. There were two races at the same time, and she was completing her first 100 miler (160 km), already longer than 30 hours on her feet. She waved goodbye, gave me her last charming smile, started going downhill, and quickly disappeared.

Physically, she was much better than me, but ultra-running is very much about mental toughness, and I was not even near her level. She had mastered that. How can I become like her? How can we become the person we would like to be? Essentially, there is only one answer — we keep practicing, and after a few thousand hours, we are done. Sad but true, and no one has come up with any better idea. But what does it take to dedicate your life to something that takes decades to achieve? Why do only a few succeed in their journey while the majority give up along the way? Why do we lose motivation, and why does it even appear in the first place?

Essentially, the only way to fail in ultra-running is to give up. It's a long journey, full of suffering and questioning yourself, `Why am I doing this?` Mastering a musical instrument, writing a book, or doing anything else that requires years of practice is similar.

What does it take to not give up and become a master?

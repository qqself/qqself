  <h1 class="title">Achieving mastery takes decades - how to keep going?</h1>
  <div class="description">
    <div class="text"><p>Very few succeed in reaching mastery, and most give up along this lifelong journey. Why does motivation disappear after just a few lessons with your new musical instrument or gym visits? Why do we go strong for multiple years and one day just abandon something that constantly was giving us joy? You can become a master at anything, and the only way to fail is to give up.</p>
<br>
<p>There are a lot of amazing books about how to achieve mastery, interviews with top masters, and papers about long-term motivation. Based on them, we've created a mastering system and an app to give you the tools to support your lifetime journey.</p>

<h3 id="journal">Journal</h3>
<p>It all starts with journaling - a place where you write down all your practice sessions. Reflection is the key element in becoming better at anything. You write in a custom format that is easy to write, but also possible for the application to process:</p>
<br>
<pre><code>    09:00 09:50 drums. Working on double pedal speed
    13:00 14:30 run distance=15 elevation=340
    15:00 15:30 stretch
    19:00 21:00 sculpture of &quot;David&quot;. Good arm progress, need to revisit posture
</code></pre>
<br>
<h3 id="identity-levelling">Identity levelling</h3>
<p>Time spent on skill practice is not enough to guarantee that you will become a master one day, but it is certainly a necessary element. We have built a leveling system that awards you arbitrary points for achievements. It takes ten thousand hours to reach level 100:</p>
<br>
<pre><code>    Runner      64 level (945 hours)
    Drummer     35 level (130 hours)
    Sculptor    18 level  (33 hours)
</code></pre>
<br>
<h3 id="deliberate-practice">Deliberate practice</h3>
<p>Not all time spent on practice is equal. One hour of deliberate practice, working on your weakest point, or performing in a competition may be as valuable as multiple hours of your usual practice routine. To encourage such activities, they are counted as three times longer, giving you a great boost in leveling:</p>
<br>
<pre><code>    10:00 12:00 run distance=15. practice of intervals. Intervals 10 x 1km
    13:00 15:00 sculpture. practice of anatomy. Skull structure and back bones
    18:00 19:00 drums. practice of &quot;Legs drills&quot;
</code></pre>
<br>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<p>Mastery requires dedication, but don't limit yourself to one area. It's a great feeling to see yourself becoming better across many different skills:</p>
<br>
<pre><code>    Great job - you&#x27;ve practiced 1000 hours across all the skills this year!
</code></pre>

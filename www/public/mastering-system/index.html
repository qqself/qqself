<h2 id="mastering-system">Mastering system</h2>
<p>&quot;Mastering System&quot; is a comprehensive overview of long-term skill development. It seeks to answer the main question, &quot;Why do we give up?&quot; and explores what helps us to keep going. There are numerous books about skill development and interviews with top-of-the-field masters, and this book incorporates wisdom from those sources. What sets this book apart, however, is not only the description of the system but also an app that utilizes all the information from the book.</p>
<p>You can use this book on its own and simply apply the advice and strategies in your daily life, or you can give <a href="https://www.qqself.com/">qqself</a> a try.</p>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>I met her at the 86th kilometer of my first 100 km ultra-running race. I could barely walk, and every step was nothing but pain. As she passed me, she asked, <code>How's it going?</code> — something I had heard many times in the last 18 hours. I was amazed at how happy she looked: her smile, her eyes full of joy. Maybe it was the evening sun and the moving clouds, but I think I saw her glowing. There were two races at the same time, and she was completing 100 miler (160 km), already longer than 30 hours on her feet. She waved goodbye, gave me her last charming smile, started going downhill, and quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Physically, she was better than me, but ultra-running is very much about mental toughness, and I was not even near her level. She had mastered that. How can I become like her? How can we become the person we would like to be? Essentially, there is only one answer — we keep practicing, and after a few thousand hours, we are done. No one has come up with any better idea. But what does it take to dedicate your life to something that takes decades to achieve? Why do only a few succeed in their journey while the majority give up along the way? Why do we lose motivation, and why does it even appear in the first place?</p>
<p>Essentially, the only way to fail in ultra-running is to give up. It's a long journey, full of suffering and questioning yourself, <code>Why am I doing this?</code> Mastering a musical instrument, writing a book, or doing anything else that requires years of practice is similar. What does it take to not give up and become a master?</p>
<h2 id="identities">Identities</h2>
<p>If you Google &quot;How to write a book?&quot; you'll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps. </p>
<p>Our daily life is full of choices, and having an identity helps us to choose. Being a sculptor is not only about spending time handling clay in your hands—it's also about learning how to see things, noticing beauty (or horrors and creepiness for some of us) in existing art. If you are a writer, then planning to spend a Friday evening in the library sounds great because that's what writers do. Being a drummer means listening to music becomes an active experience where you carefully listen to how drums are used in the song. Identities guide us in the right directions and keep us aligned with long-term goals.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to fail at an identity. If you are a runner but didn't run for half of the year because of an injury, you are still a runner. If you just wrote your first 10 pages, you are a writer -not a good one yet, but a writer on the way to becoming better.</p>
<p>Identities work much better in the long run. Compare it to the common New Year resolution: Some may decide to write one page every day, but then life happens, and one day is lost. The plan has failed; it's not every day anymore, and giving up on the whole idea becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery is always full of terrible mistakes and wrong turns. You may be playing the piano for a long time and one day realize that you have the wrong hand posture. Or doing sculpture and realising that progress is impossible unless you spend a lot of time learning human anatomy. These may become the lowest points where you are demotivated, lost, and hopeless. Having an identity helps in such cases—it's like a compass that shows you a direction. You would still need time to bypass a sudden obstacle, but it will ensure you get back on track.</p>
<p>Decide who you want to become, write it down, and put it somewhere where you will see it many times a day. Sometimes it's best to put it somewhere where no one else can see it. It's hard to write &quot;Iron Man Triathlete&quot; if you've been a couch potato all your life and afraid that people may laugh at it. Hide it for now; it's temporary, and one day you'll wear those Iron Man cap, bag, and other swag on a daily basis, showing others who you've become.</p>

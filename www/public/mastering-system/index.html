<h2 id="mastering-system">Mastering system</h2>
<p><code>Mastering System</code> is a comprehensive overview of long-term skill development. It seeks to answer the main question: <code>Why do we give up?</code> and explores what helps us to keep going. There are numerous books about skill development and interviews with top-of-the-field masters, and this book incorporates wisdom from those. What sets this book apart, is not only the description of the system but also an app that utilizes all the information from the book.</p>
<p>You can use this book on its own and simply apply advices and strategies in your daily life, or you can give <a href="https://www.qqself.com/">qqself</a> a try.</p>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>All my life, I've hated running because I was terrible at it, but here I am finishing my very first 100 kilometers ultra-running race. I can barely walk, and the whole event feels more like ultra-crawling. I didn't expect what it would be, and I made all the possible mistakes. If someone were to tell you that ultra-running is a fun adventure full of joy, then it's a lie - it's about discomfort, pain, and suffering.</p>
<p>There is no joy in it. You can feel it only in the very first 10 minutes of the run when you start. And then after you cross the finish line. And then for about a week, even when you can still barely move, every moment of your existence is filled with a feeling of accomplishment and pure happiness. And then, any time you remember that race, you feel proud, knowing what you've achieved.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery in any skill is a long journey with thousands of hours of exhausting practice near your limits, which is far away from being called joyful. We are happy to do that because of what it brings us - a feeling of getting better, a feeling of accomplishment, and the ability to do what was impossible before.</p>
<p>Every skill, every master, and every scholar are unique, yet there are common reasons why novices give up just after they've started. There is a common issue of plateau when you seem to be no longer progressing, and many more issues that arise in front of everyone on the way to mastery of every skill. </p>
<p>There are numerous books and reports from the best masters that we can learn from - what strategies musicians use to perfect their skill; what strategies writers use to focus on their work and avoid distraction of the daily life; what keeps us motivated and how to deal with the failures. All the is the <code>Mastering System</code>.</p>
<h2 id="identities">Identities</h2>
<p>If you Google &quot;How to write a book?&quot; you'll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps.</p>
<p>Our daily life is full of choices, and having an identity helps us to choose. Being a sculptor is not only about spending time handling clay in your hands—it's also about learning how to see things, noticing beauty (or horrors and creepiness for some of us) in existing art. If you are a writer, then planning to spend a Friday evening in the library sounds great because that's what writers do. Being a drummer means listening to music becomes an active experience where you carefully listen to how drums are used in the song. Identities guide us in the right directions and keep us aligned with long-term goals.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to fail at an identity. If you are a runner but didn't run for half of the year because of an injury, you are still a runner. If you just wrote your first 10 pages, you are a writer -not a good one yet, but a writer on the way to become better.</p>
<p>Identities work much better in the long run. Compare it to the common New Year resolution: Some may decide to write one page every day, but then life happens, and one day is lost. The plan has failed; it's not every day anymore, and giving up on the whole idea becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery is always full of terrible mistakes and wrong turns. You may be playing the piano for a long time and one day realize that you have the wrong hand posture. Or doing sculpture and realizing that progress is impossible unless you spend a lot of time learning human anatomy. These may become the lowest points where you are demotivated, lost, and hopeless. Having an identity helps in such cases—it's like a compass that shows you a direction. You would still need time to bypass a sudden obstacle, but it will ensure you get back on track.</p>
<p>Decide who you want to become, write it down, and put it somewhere where you will see it many times a day. Sometimes it's best to put it somewhere where no one else can see it. It's hard to write &quot;Iron Man Triathlete&quot; if you've been a couch potato all your life and afraid that people may laugh at it. Hide it for now; it's temporary, and one day you'll wear those Iron Man cap, bag, and other swag on a daily basis, showing others who you've become.</p>

<h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
<p>Learning a new skill may feel like encountering nothing but failures on this path. Like a cruel teacher, it punishes you when you make mistakes, demotivating you and filling you with doubt about your ability to continue. Regardless of how much we dislike these teaching methods, we often play this role ourselves – criticizing what we've done, pointing out areas that could have been improved, or deciding that our new creation is worth only slightly more than garbage.</p>
<p>It might seem like a curse to have a teacher like that, but despite its archaic methods, its goal is to teach you and help you improve – pointing out your mistakes and ensuring you never repeat them. Mistakes are nothing but pointers to your weakest points. By addressing these weak points within the skill, you will strengthen the entire foundation and move closer to mastery. Your weakest point sets the maximum limit for what you can achieve with this skill. It's an infinite process where solving one issue reveals the next.</p>
<p>To learn the lesson, there is one thing you need to do: reflect on it. What exactly happened and what mistakes did you make? Why did it happen, and what needs to be done to prevent it in the future? What exactly is the weakest point that surfaced and caused the mistake?</p>
<p>Every time we start something new, we imagine how things will go: how much time we will need, what the final result will be. It's almost never the case that things go according to our plans, and a nasty surprise at the beginning could invalidate the entire plan, leading us to give up and consider the plan a failure.</p>
<p>We tend to overestimate what we can achieve in a short time and, instead of struggling against it, we should accept it. The result that we imagine before starting a new project is perfection – something we would achieve if everything went perfectly. This is your first plan. </p>
<p>However, think about how seldom things go perfectly in life – there are always some unexpected surprises. How would the end result look in such cases? This is your secondary plan in case the first perfect plan fails. </p>
<p>Now, imagine if things were to go terribly wrong: the weather during your run would be awful, clay would crack on your model, or your wrist would start to ache after just 10 minutes of drumming. What would you do in these cases? What would the end result be in such bad luck? This is your third plan in case the first two fail.</p>
<p>Having three plans solves the problem of wrong expectations and overestimation. It keeps things closer to reality, and when you fail to achieve things according to your first plan, you know that you've failed to achieve perfection, which is quite a rare outcome anyway. You know that you didn't completely fail, you've failed to execute it perfectly. You switch to the second plan and keep going, and often things will go according to it. Sometimes, though, you are unlucky and mistakes keep happening. The third plan is for such cases – when things are terrible, but you keep going to reach the finish line no matter what.</p>
<p>Having three plans is a common strategy on ultra marathons. There are few people who competes on those races, but for majority ultras is all about crossing a finish line, it's a mental fight with yourselves - can you do it or not, to fail on ultras is to give up. Most common ultra distances are 100km and 100 miles (160km) which takes up to 40 hours to complete. </p>
<p>Everyone comes with some plan: how long each part of the race should take, how to approach hills or mountains, where to make breaks and what the final time would be. In 40 hours there are a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong. Realising that you are 5 hours behind what you've planned will crush your motivation and likely makes you to give up. Having 3 plans helps you to keep going, to accept that things may be not perfect, but it's still worth to keep going and finally reach the finish line.</p>

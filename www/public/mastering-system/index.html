<p>I met her at the 86th kilometer of my first 100 km ultra-running race. I could barely walk, and every step was nothing but pain. As she passed me, she asked, <code>How's it going?</code> — something I had heard many times in the last 18 hours, but this time it was different. I was amazed at how happy she looked: her smile, her eyes full of joy. Maybe it was the evening sun and the moving clouds, but I think I saw her glowing. There were two races at the same time, and she was completing her first 100 miler (160 km), already longer than 30 hours on her feet. She waved goodbye, gave me her last charming smile, started going downhill, and quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Physically, she was much better than me, but ultra-running is very much about mental toughness, and I was not even near her level. She had mastered that. How can I become like her? How can we become the person we would like to be? Essentially, there is only one answer — we keep practicing, and after a few thousand hours, we are done. Sad but true, and no one has come up with any better idea. But what does it take to dedicate your life to something that takes decades to achieve? Why do only a few succeed in their journey while the majority give up along the way? Why do we lose motivation, and why does it even appear in the first place?</p>
<p>Essentially, the only way to fail in ultra-running is to give up. It's a long journey, full of suffering and questioning yourself, <code>Why am I doing this?</code> Mastering a musical instrument, writing a book, or doing anything else that requires years of practice is similar.</p>
<p>What does it take to not give up and become a master?</p>
<h2 id="mastering-system">Mastering system</h2>
<p>&quot;Mastering System&quot; is a comprehensive overview of long-term skill development. It seeks to answer the main question, &quot;Why do we give up?&quot; and explores what helps us to keep going. There are numerous books about skill development and interviews with top-of-the-field masters, and this book incorporates wisdom from those sources. What sets this book apart, however, is not only the description of the system but also an app that utilizes all the information from the book.</p>
<p>You can use this book on its own and simply apply the advice and strategies in your daily life, or you can give <a href="https://www.qqself.com/">qqself</a> a try.</p>
<h2 id="identities">Identities</h2>
<p>I've spent the first 30 years of my life in front of the computer. I didn't think life had anything to offer besides what I saw on my screen, and I myself didn't have anything to offer to this world outside of the digital realm. Among all the sports, I hated running the most; in school, I was terrible at it, always finishing last in class. I was convinced that I had no talent for music and art; after all, only a few of us have that, right?</p>
<p>Mastering anything takes years, even decades of practice, but unfortunately, our brains have a tendency to overestimate what could be achieved in the short term and underestimate what could be done in the long term. Can you imagine yourself playing or singing in front of a crowd at a concert? Watching the movie that you've directed? Meeting the  second sunrise in the mountains of Mont Blanc after running 100km? It's almost impossible if you've never done anything like that before.</p>
<p>When we set our goals, we attach them to the current state of things; we estimate what we will be able to do in 10 years based on what we can do right now. When we think about our future, we look at what we have right now who we are currently.</p>
<p>If you Google &quot;How to write a book?&quot; you'll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps. It's your new role, which will guide you in your daily life; it's your new identity.</p>

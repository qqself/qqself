<p>Talking about skill development that takes tens of years to master, the main problem is not to give up. With such a long way to the top, we would face a lot of perfect opportunities to abandon the whole idea. Some skills require hundreds of hours to invest before you can see any results. To make things harder - those results would not be impressive at all. With almost every skill, you spend the most time on a plateau without feeling progress. With other skills, we may give up even before we've tried them because we assume it will be impossible for us to learn them.</p>
<p>How can we become the person that we would like to become?</p>
<p>Essentially there is only one answer - we keep practicing and learning, and after a few thousands of hours, we are done. Unfortunately, there is no other way, and no one has come up with any better idea. On the other hand, people have invented many different methods to help make learning and practicing more effective and overcome short-term difficulties. Using those technics, we could overcome the main issue of giving up, help us in the lowest point, fight through the plateau, recover, and continue the journey. Then eventually, we will reach success.</p>
<h2 id="giving-up-before">Giving up before</h2>
<p>People tend to underestimate what can be achieved in the long term. When we make our goals, we attach them to the current state of things; we estimate what we will be able to do in 10 years based on what we can do right now. It's almost impossible even to imagine ourselves becoming a sculptor, directing a movie, or having a crowd singing your song at a concert if we have never done something like that before.</p>
<p>In reality, we could achieve a lot in 10-20 years. With 5 hours a week, you'll get to 5000 hours of practice, which is enough to reach advanced levels in many skills. Talent plays a significant role in becoming top of the field, but getting the top 1% is very much doable with the right dedication and proper practice almost in every skill.</p>
<p>Another problem is that we have the least amount of information before we start. It's the most unclear situation, and there are no ideas about where to begin. The complexity and amount of unknowns could be so overwhelming that we consider acquiring such skills impossible.</p>
<h2 id="giving-up-in-the-beginning">Giving up in the beginning</h2>
<p>In the beginning, we may feel the excitement - &quot;It's a beginning of a journey. Soon, I'll become a master!&quot; As we start from zero, almost every minute of practicing improves our skills; we see the progress and the results. It's a beautiful time, but soon you'll start noticing that progress is slowing down. You become aware of all the things you are missing and the things you need to practice and learn. You'll realize how long, challenging, and difficult the journey of becoming a master will be. Surprisingly you'll feel more distant from achieving mastery after you've invested some time in learning than you thought before starting it when you knew nothing. You become aware of the skill's complexity and may think it's impossible to master it.</p>
<p>With some skills, the excitement period may be as short as unboxing time. You may have a dream to make music. Unfortunately, with many musical instruments, you will not make any music for a very long time. In the beginning, practice will contain many exercises and lessons that are hardly similar to your favorite song you hope to play one day.</p>
<h2 id="giving-up-because-the-whole-thing-is-stupid-111">Giving up because the whole thing is stupid!!!111</h2>
<p>Learning is tough. Sometimes it's physically exhausting, and your body reaches its limit, and you can't continue. But much more often, toughness is mental, caused by an infinite flow of errors, mistakes, and failures. It's an essence of learning - we start with something we can't do, and through exercise and practice, we acquire a new skill. We learn from our mistakes. It's a feedback system, a crucial part of long-term improvement. If we are stuck with something for a long time, we can't progress, and things don't work, we may reach the limit and give up on the whole thing.</p>
<h2 id="giving-up-because-i-will-never-reach-mastery">Giving up because I will never reach mastery</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I don't have a talent.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It took months, but my friend learned it in 1 hour.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I'll never reach the level of this guy.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>We constantly compare ourselves with others. To ensure that this is always unfair, we compare one &quot;I&quot; with many others: &quot;This one reached mastery in 5 years; That one is better at A; That is better at B; I'm worse than each of them&quot;.</p>
<p>Often, we see others only when they perform, their showcase what they have learned after years of practice, where it looks like they do things effortlessly. We think it's because they have talent, which we do not have. We rarely see their struggle, how they spent thousands of hours exactly like us, frustrated, making mistakes, learning, and slowly progressing.</p>
<h2 id="giving-up-because-it-s-boooooring">Giving up because it's boooooring</h2>
<p>Things we can do - we don't want to do.</p>
<p>Things we want to do - we can't do.</p>
<p>Learning skills could be defined by what we can do with them - The better we become, the more capabilities we have. We open new possibilities, something that wasn't possible before suddenly becomes open for us. It is a reward that keeps us motivated to continue practicing and investing in the skill. If we structure our training wrong, if we are not becoming better, we will be stuck and may eventually give up.</p>

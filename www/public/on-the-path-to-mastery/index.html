<h2 id="on-the-path-to-mastery">On The Path To Mastery</h2>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>There are many books about mastery, but whenever I read a story about a gifted child who has been passionate about music since they were 5 years old, a part of me dies. When you read interviews with masters, it's as if they are from a different dimension: doing it their whole life, constantly motivated, always improving, willing to sacrifice everything not related to their craft.</p>
<p>Is there a path to mastery for others? For those without a particular talent, whose motivation is unstable, and who have started things many times but given up just as often?</p>
<p>Saying &quot;<code>either you are motivated to make it or not</code>&quot; makes motivation seem like some sort of magic ability that only a few possess. But where exactly does motivation come from for those who wake up at 5 AM on a Saturday for a long run? And why do some people abandon their favorite hobby after years of pure joy?</p>
<p>We don't lose motivation just because. Things that brought us joy yesterday don't suddenly become boring today by itself. There are reasons behind those changes, and understanding them can help us keep going.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery takes decades: many years of tough practice, learning, making mistakes, feeling embarrassments and self doubt. This book is about everything that keeps us going, that keeps us from giving up: From the explanation why things happen to the daily practices and strategies that may improve our motivation when we feel down, when we need all the support we can get to fight through. </p>
<p>You can read this book on it's own - you only need pen and paper to implement ideas from this book. There is also a more convenient way - <a href="https://www.qqself.com">qqself</a> app which uses all the practices and strategies from this book. </p>
<h2 id="dream">Dream</h2>
<p>It was 5 minutes before the midnight, I was waiting on a start line on my very first 100 km ultra running marathon. At the start of the race, everyone is nervous and excited about the adventure that lies in front of them. I was standing there in the crowd, feeling motivated to show my best, experiencing fear about what awaits me, and full of doubt about whether I can actually do it or not.</p>
<p>Ultra running, in essence, is all about crossing a finish line - enduring 20, 30, or even 40 hours of suffering, experiencing ups and downs, feeling exhausted, pushing your physical limits, and being torn between two conflicting desires: the willingness to finish no matter what, and the urge to end the pain, give up, and return back to comfortable and easy life.</p>
<p>Depending on the race's difficulty, ranging from 15% to up to 50%, runners will give up and never reach the finish line. It's almost impossible to become so exhausted, to reach such a physical state where you actually cannot take another step - our brains give up much sooner than that. When that happens, <code>I am a failure and not a runner</code> is the only thought that fills the mind; it's a crushing feeling that I've experienced myself.</p>
<p>After such failure, you rest for a few days, and then start to regret that you gave up too soon. You wish you could have held on a bit longer; maybe you could have recovered and finished the race. What you never have regrets about is the run itself. Regardless of how much suffering you went through, regardless of whether you gave up in the end - you are glad that you tried.</p>
<p>From all those who stand at a starting line, many are going to give up along the way, but there are many more who gave up before and never allowed themselves to start.</p>
<p>We cannot start a path to mastery if we never allowed ourselves to dream about it - to accept that it's possible. When we imagine how the future may look like, we limit our imagination based on what we have right now. We imagine slightly better version of ourselves - a 1 or 2 steps higher in the corporate ladder, a bit more money on our account, slightly stronger and better at things we do now. We dream based on who we are right now, rather than based on who we want to become.</p>
<p>We tend to underestimate what could be achieved in the long term. In 10-20 years, you could become a completely different person if you wish to be. You could become a musician, a writer, an athlete, an artist, or a scientist working to cure cancer. It might sound crazy right now to even think about it, but this thought is only crazy now.</p>
<p>Think about how much you've changed between the ages of 10 and 20. From 20 to 30? There are hardly any similarities between those phases, and the same could happen again if you are willing to make it so.</p>
<p>Growing up, we notice that some things are easier than others. You may be good at math and computers, while others can talk to people easily. As we become adults, we choose professions related to the things we do well, and after some time, our minds become fixed: <code>I'm good at it because I have been good at it all my life. I cannot become good at anything else</code>.</p>
<p>We don't allow ourselves to even think about trying new things unless, by some magic, we are already good at them. We think that a natural gift is a requirement for entry. The existence of talent is questionable, and Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool describe it well in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS">Peak</a> that it's not some magical ability we are born with, but rather the result of our environment when we are young and a product of grit and practice for those who have reached mastery.</p>
<p>It's hard to rewire our minds, and it may take a long time to convince ourselves that talent is not needed to start a path toward any kind of mastery. Fine, talent does exist; there are people with gifts from the time they are born, and you have it for only a few skills. Think of talent as a multiplier of your effort - if you have a gift, then all your effort is multiplied by 110%. For skills in which you have no natural talent, the modifier is 90% - it would take a longer time to reach a certain level of mastery. The numbers are arbitrary, but the point is, the absence of a natural gift only affects the speed at which you progress. If the path to mastery takes 20 years for some and 25 years for others, it's hardly a reason not to try.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>I'm not good with music</code> - said by someone who has never tried any musical instrument</li>
<li><code>I'm bad at art</code> - said by someone who has never learned it</li>
<li><code>I'm a bad swimmer</code> - saying one who has never trained</li>
</ul>
<p>We are supposed to be bad at things we've never practiced. It should never be a reason for not allowing ourselves to dream about them and try them.</p>
<p>We all have our own limits, obstacles, and environments that don't allow us to make an immediate change, but these factors shouldn't limit what we dream about. Allow yourself to dream; forget about limits - if you want to terraform Mars, then let it be your dream. There is no path to mastery without desire, and there is no desire without a dream. Allowing yourself to dream is like coming to the starting line of a race - it's giving yourself a chance to finish.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to dream - dreaming permits imagination without limits. Limits may exists and learning skill may be only about removing such limits, but dream is a first step to be able to set a goal. </p>
<p>Mastery takes decades to reach; it's a long journey in which very few succeed. The chances of crossing the finish line are low, but you will be glad that you tried.</p>
<h2 id="what-comes-after-dream">What comes after dream?</h2>
<p>A dream is a vague idea, often lacking a clear first step and a concrete final destination. It's like a blurry vision where you see yourself in a spacesuit working on the Moon or sitting in a chair in your studio, writing a book. Dreams are expected to be unclear and idealistic views of the new you.</p>
<p><code>I want to become a sculptor</code> is a dream. It's fine that there is no clear way to start, and it's also okay that there is no concrete destination. Am I already a sculptor if I've made a goose from plasticine with my kid? Would I become one after taking a few courses or only after my first local exhibition? Clarity is not expected here.</p>
<p>I remember reading a book about free diving and scientists who dedicated their lives to researching whales in the Gulf of Mexico, swimming alongside these creatures and sharks in the ocean. I was so immersed in the story, imagining myself there and then dream appeared - <code>whales</code>.</p>
<p>It's not clear if that dream is about learning how to free dive, researching whales, or simply swimming in the ocean in general. However, since that day, I've started to spend more time in open water, and it has become an environment that draws me in.</p>
<p>Don't dismiss a dream if it's unclear. If your friend showed you his new car, and you were fascinated by the way the engine looked, write it down: <code>car</code>, <code>engine</code>, <code>where is the engine in an electric car?</code> or any word, phrase, or question that will bring you back to that experience. It was something that created an emotional reaction; there is something interesting hidden there that's worth digging.</p>
<p>Things will become clear afterward, often in unexpected ways. You may start with an abstract idea like <code>typewriter</code> and then, half a year later, find yourself spending your summer vacation in a distant mountain cabin, writing the first draft of your book.</p>

<p>Ask any ultra runner in the race, and you'll find that no one actually runs the full distance. Experiencing the suffering and pain, which are constant companions in ultras, and keeping in mind that it will last for another 20 or 30 hours, is a crushing feeling that can break even the strongest.</p>
<p>What athletes do instead is split the race into multiple smaller parts and concentrate their thoughts only on the current stage. When you reach a checkpoint, you pat yourself on the back, say <code>Great job I've done here!</code> and choose the next checkpoint and run towards that.</p>
<p>There are two requirements that a checkpoint must satisfy to work:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be meaningful and require effort to reach. Setting the next checkpoint just 5 minutes from the last is too easy and wouldn't create a sense of achievement that gives us strength and a motivation boost</li>
<li>It has to be clear when we reach it, but it's expected to be unclear how to reach it. A checkpoint could be on top of a mountain, but you have no idea how to climb there with such tired legs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Think what could be the next checkpoint for your dream? </p>
<h2 id="starting">Starting</h2>
<p>When you start a new endeavor, like learning to play the piano, you are only truly learning when you practice. It's only when you run that you become better at it. It's only when you sculpt that you become a sculptor.</p>
<p>Listening to how other people play, watching others explain how to sculpt, or reading articles on getting started with running has no effect on your skill. You only make progress when you practice. All tutorials, lectures, books, and learning videos have no direct effect on your skill until you start applying them and practicing. Watching getting-started videos on YouTube creates an illusion that we are learning and becoming better, while in reality, we are lying down on a coach for an hour, not moving.</p>
<p>It's entertaining to watch other people's stories; it's safe because you cannot make a mistake while others are doing it, and it's easy to drink tea while sitting on a couch and watching other people suffer while climbing a mountain. Don't fall into the trap of infinite preparation. <code>I need to know what to expect</code> is an excuse to delay a discomforting and scary moment when you need to step out of your comfort home and get your shoes dirty on your first run.</p>
<p>Some minimum preparation is always needed – by all means, check how to do a proper deadlift before you hit the gym. Watch one or two videos, get to know the exercises for the proper technique, but keep in mind that you cannot learn it while lying down on the sofa. It's a waste of time to keep watching big guys on YouTube, waiting for full understanding – it will never come, as understanding comes from practice. It's a waste of time to wait until you feel confident, as confidence comes only from doing.</p>
<p>Don't get paralysed by the choice. Searching for <code>best violin for beginners</code> will yield millions of pages, and it's tempting to search for <code>best page with the best violins for beginners</code> to find the best rank first. Choose whatever, or even better, visit your local music store, ask for beginner options, get one that they have in stock and have your first practice session already this evening.</p>
<p>When you begin with new skills, the focus should be on starting to do it. Reading or watching videos doesn't count; finding a perfect course is a waste of time – any would do. Go for a run with whatever shoes and clothes you use for work; for sculpting, take plasticine from your kids or mud from the street. Instead of searching for a gym, start doing pushups and ab crunches in your living room.</p>
<p>When we start learning a new skill, any kind of choice will be wrong and, at the same time, irrelevant. Which is better, electronic drums or acoustic? Is a course about colour theory any good? Should I get oil clay, polymer one, or a water-based? At the beginning, we are least qualified to make a choice.</p>
<p>Anything you choose is wrong because, in the beginning, we don't know what we actually want. <code>I want to run</code> is too abstract to choose the right pair of shoes - one for sprinting is different from one for marathon on a trail. <code>I want to play drums</code> is too vague, as a drum kit for metal differs from one for jazz. You need to make a choice now, but you will understand what you actually prefer long after.</p>
<p>At the same time, anything you choose is irrelevant, as you will not feel the difference between a metal or jazz drum set just yet. The quality of your sculptures will not be affected by what type of clay you choose or what kind of paints or brushes you select for your painting.</p>
<p>When you start learning a new skill, choose whatever can get you to practice as soon as possible. Select the course that begins tomorrow, pick shoes that the shop near you has in stock. Focus on practice, learn the nuances of your craft, and then you will be able to understand which choices are essential and how to make the right ones.</p>
<p>Don't become better at preparation for running, but become better in running itself.</p>
<h2 id="identities">Identities</h2>
<p>If you Google <code>How to write a book?</code> you'll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps.</p>
<p>Our daily life is full of choices, and having an identity helps us to choose. Being a sculptor is not only about spending time handling clay in your hands—it's also about learning how to see things, noticing beauty (or horrors and creepiness for some of us) in life. If you are a writer, then planning to spend a Friday evening in the library sounds great because that's what writers do. Being a drummer means listening to music becomes an active experience where you carefully listen to how drums are used in the song. Identities guide us in the right directions and keep us aligned with long-term goals.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to fail at an identity. If you are a runner but didn't run for half of the year because of an injury, you are still a runner. If you just wrote your first 10 pages, you are a writer - not a good one yet, but a writer on the way to become better.</p>
<p>Identities work much better in the long run. Compare it to the common New Year resolution: Some may decide to write one page every day, but then life happens, and one day is lost. The plan has failed; it's not every day anymore, and giving up on the whole idea becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery is always full of mistakes and wrong turns. You may be playing the piano for a long time and one day realize that you have the wrong hand posture. Or doing sculpture and realizing that progress is impossible unless you spend a lot of time learning human anatomy. These may become the lowest points where you are demotivated, lost, and hopeless. Having an identity helps in such cases - it's like a compass that shows you a direction. You would still need time to bypass a sudden obstacle, but it will ensure you get back on track.</p>
<p>Decide who you want to become, write it down, and put it somewhere where you will see it many times a day. Sometimes it's best to put it somewhere where no one else can see it. It's hard to write <code>Iron Man Triathlete</code> if you've been a couch potato all your life and afraid that people may laugh at it. Hide it for now; it's temporary, and one day you'll wear those Iron Man cap, bag, and other swag on a daily basis, showing others who you've become.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>Feeling of progress is the main motivator in skill learning. You become better, unlock things that were not possible before, and see the results of your practice and training. When progress is invisible, it's hard to continue putting effort into learning.</p>
<p>In some skills, the hardest part is the beginning. With musical instruments, at first, you'll be making sounds instead of music. Going to the gym in the first few months will result in muscle pain rather than muscle growth. Pursuing art will yield ugliness, rather than beauty.</p>
<p>There might be no clear markers of progress. This is a main reason why newcomers often give up in the beginning—they see no results from their efforts. It's also why people who have been practicing a skill for many years can hardly understand why newcomers quit. When you've reached advanced levels of the skill, it continues to deliver results: you earn medals for race participations, have new sculptures on a shelf, or add learned songs to your repertoire.</p>
<p>There is one metric that keeps progressing, regardless of your skill level or the type of skill you're practicing: time. Time spent on skill practice is the best indicator for beginners to have a sense of progress. Setting arbitrary goals like spending 5 hours a week in the gym, achieving a total of 50 hours there, or reaching 200 hours of running per year can create a strong sense of progress until the skill itself starts showing it.</p>
<p>Not all time spent is equal, and time spent is not a perfect indicator - optimizing this metric might lead to spending a lot of time in the gym doing nothing. It's not a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that your company needs to optimize. It's a number that you measure, not one you optimize. It's a number for yourself alone, not a public figure you share on social networks.</p>
<p>The lack of a feeling of progress can affect not only newcomers. In fact, when you've reached more advanced levels, most of the time is spent on a plateau. This can be even more frustrating than for newcomers, as you put more effort into pushing your limits, yet mastery might seem farther away than you can achieve. One way to break through such plateaus is patience, time, and deliberate practice.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice involves focusing on your weakest points and working towards improving them.</p>
<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>
<p>Many know how to rest, but few know how to recover. To keep moving and getting better day after day, year after year we have to learn how to recover. </p>
<p>Rest means not doing an activity, while recovery means doing something that help us get energy back and be ready to practice again. Lying on a sofa is a rest, but it's not really recovering. Actually, just lying on a sofa can be a way to recover, and it's actually quite difficult to do – just lying there without holding a phone or watching TV.</p>
<p>Many times, when we feel tired, we turn to things that entertain us: games, Netflix or watching cats on YouTube. Watching cats can be relaxing and definitely entertaining, but it doesn't help us to recover and doesn't restore our mental energy levels. Almost any kind of consumption requires cognitive effort and doesn't give our brain a proper break.</p>
<p>Some skills require physical recovery, but all skills require the restoration of mental energy. We skip training not because we physically cannot get to the gym, but because we cannot convince ourselves to go there. When our mental capacity is exhausted, we feel like we've lost motivation and interest in doing things – all because we've failed to give our brain a chance to recover.</p>
<p>In our modern world, filled with many distractions, we need to consciously make an effort to give our brains a break from constant stimulation.</p>
<p>Sleep is the most effective way to recover, and a full night of sleep have the greatest impact on energy levels. When you read about masters or scholars who have gone through intense learning, you may find that daily naps mentioned frequently. </p>
<p>Activities like meditation, taking a walk outside, reading a book, taking shower or even simply sitting quietly can provide an effective recovery. Being lost in doing music or art can provide an effective way to recover as well.</p>
<p>When feeling tired don't rest - recover. </p>
<h2 id="consumption">Consumption</h2>
<p>If you decide to watch all <code>getting started for runners</code> videos, you'll die before you go for a first run. You can find an answer on any question you have and this is what we, as a humanity, have gifted to ourselves. You can explore new skills, get inspired, find instructions, training plans or race reports. Lack of information is not a problem anymore - we can find information about any skill and start learning it from any point in the world.</p>
<p>We can watch races and competitions, see interviews with masters and sometimes get so close to them and observe how they work and live in real time. </p>
<p>Watching others may inspire us, we can learn from it and we can become better at doing. But sometimes watching others makes us do less. You may have a need, a desire to satisfy: willingness to move, to go for a run, idea of a new project or emotion that you want to express yourself in art. Watch a video how others do that and your brain will be satisfied, the need will become less strong or disappear completely. Watching how others do sports decreases a willingness to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Watch an adventure movie, all the emotions: desire to explore the unknowns, curiosity, novelty, fear and excitement, satisfaction in the end, will be real, but actually you've been laying down on a sofa without moving for 2 hours. </p>
<p>Watching how others are doing things makes us compare. You watch how people running in a desert, on top on volcano or in Amazon jungles and then having a run in the forest close to you become boring. You want to make a sculpture, to express yourselves, to capture your emotions in clay, but after watching few videos of other better sculptors, you see clearly that you are not as good as them and motivation is shuttered. </p>
<p>Watching others doing things may have a negative impact on feeling our identities. Writing a book makes you feel more as a writer; feeling more as a writer makes you write more. But when we watch interviews with top writers about their new released book we may feel doubt about ourselves - maybe I am not a writer? </p>
<h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
<p>Failures are the main reason why we give up. It could be just in the beginning where we start learning new skill with high expectations only to be crushed by the it's difficulty. Or when you become good at it, after years of practice, realising that it's impossible to be as good as masters. </p>
<p>Failures is like a cruel teacher that punishes you when you make mistake and fills us with doubt about our ability to continue. It might seem like a curse to have a teacher like that, but despite its archaic methods, its goal is to teach you. </p>
<p>Failures are just pointers to our weakest points: To some part of our skill that needs correction or enhancement. To the part or our skill that limits us, something which, when improved, will allow us to reach a new level and unlock capabilities that wasn't possible before.</p>
<p>To learn the lesson, there is one thing we need to do: to reflect on it. What exactly had happened and what mistakes did we make? What exactly is the weakest point that surfaced and caused the failure? Write it all down, think about your failure and by doing it you'll grow.</p>
<p>We make mistakes and recover in every skill all the time. In writing, it's more explicit than ever: the very first sentence we write is always ugly, and sometimes it's physically painful to observe how poorly we've expressed a thought on paper. It's surprising that we have ever written anything before; it's obvious that even a 2-year-old can express their thoughts in a clearer way. We delete the sentence and rewrite it, only to end up with a slightly better version of it. It's still embarrassing, but we keep going - deleting and rewriting, editing and making it clearer - until it becomes okay. By all literature standards, it's still bad, but something good starting to appear. The first version, which was nothing but a failure, transforms into something valuable and worthy.</p>

In qqself you have a journal where you write about you skill practices and can reflect about it: Comment how did you feel during a training, what exactly you've practiced or analyse what kind of mistakes did you do which requires attention.
</div></p>
  <hr />
</div>
<p>Failures also come in the form of broken plans. They could arise from mistakes due to our lack of skill, but mistakes could also be hidden within the plan itself.</p>
<p>Everyone who starts an ultra-running race has a plan. These races could last up to 40 hours, presenting numerous opportunities for things to go wrong, not in accordance with the plan. Realizing that you are 3 hours behind your intended schedule will crush your motivation and likely make you to give up. A common strategy is to have three plans.</p>
<p>The first plan assumes perfect execution—when you are performing at your best, pushing the boundaries of your capabilities, and achieving a new personal best. Since our brains tend to overestimate, the very first plan that comes to mind is usually this ideal one. When we imagine the outcomes of a new project or challenge, we often assume perfect execution. Don't fight against this; instead, accept it and make it explicit that this plan is for when luck is on your side and everything goes perfectly.</p>
<p>The second plan accepts imperfections. There will be unpleasant surprises, unexpected turns, things will be harder that what you've expected, and moments when your performance falls short of your previous best.</p>
<p>Third plan is when you left you luck at home. It's for situations when the weather is at its worst, the terrain is terrible, and your body refuses to cooperate. Generally, third plan is simply about crossing a finish line.</p>
<p>Having three plans addresses the issue of a wrong expectations and overestimation. This approach keeps your goals more aligned with reality. When you fail to achieve your objectives according to the first plan, it doesn't mean total failure; you've just failed of executing it perfectly. You can then shift to the second plan and keep going. Often, things will align with the second plan. However, there are times when misfortune persists and mistakes continue to happen. This is when the third plan comes into play—when conditions are terrible, yet you persist in reaching the finish line no matter what.</p>
<h2 id="pacing">Pacing</h2>
<p>If you begin running at a speed that you cannot maintain throughout the entire race, you will hit a wall before reaching the finish line. You'll feel a fire in your lungs, and your legs will be consumed by pain. In running, burning out is explicit and, in a sense, quite literal.</p>
<p>Mastery takes decades to reach, and correct pacing protects us from burning out and stopping in the middle. We are all capable of sprinting—maintaining a high speed for a short time that is followed by a complete body collapse and the need for recovery. You uncover the beauty and novelty of a new skill; you dedicate every evening to it, only to grow tired and fed up with it after a few weeks or months.</p>
<p>Correct pacing is difficult to find and only comes through the experience of failures resulting from choosing incorrectly. Opting for a pace that is too fast is a common mistake that can occur among both novice learners and more advanced scholars.</p>
<p>If you're feeling demotivated and have lost interest in a skill - slow down or take a break. Reflect on the amount of time you've practiced that skill in the last week/month/year, and compare it to previous periods. If you've spent 30 hours on your favourite musical instrument this month, but typically it's 20 hours, it's not surprising that you're feeling tired. If you usually write for 1 hour per day, but suddenly find yourself immersed for 3 hours, the next day's writing might seem unappealing, and it's going to be hard to find the motivation to write even a few sentences. Instead of getting upset or feeling guilty about a sudden break, accept it – you've been moving too fast and need to slow down.</p>
<p>Run too slow and guilt will be running along. You used to write 10 pages per day, but now found time to write 10 pages in a whole week. You've visited gym 3 times a week, this week you hit only once. In all those cases, we would feel guilt: not doing what we're supposed to, progressing slowly, and not giving our all.</p>
<p>Accept it - it's part of the life and no one goes without such obstacles and drops. Every week is a new, and every Monday start it all over again. Start it from the scratch without weight of the past - it doesn't matter how little you do week before, you only have this week. </p>
<p>Allow yourself to start over.</p>
<h2 id="accountability">Accountability</h2>
<p>Reaching mastery is your own personal journey—you are the only one who wants it, the only one who can achieve it, and the only one responsible for it. Be honest with yourself. If you dream of learning how to fly a plane but have done absolutely nothing towards it over a year, then it's a decision you've made. You are in charge of the entire process, and every decision (or lack thereof) is yours and yours alone. Don't lie to yourself - every day is filled with choices and you are the only one who is choosing.</p>
<p>Accountability means honesty. If the plan was to hit the gym three times a week, but in reality, you hardly visit it weekly, then be honest—you visit the gym once a week. There are always obstacles; there's always a lack of time. Sometimes, however, you can certainly recall when you found a solution: you woke up earlier, you compromised, and you found a way through. Other times, you didn't even try and accepted whatever was given to you. In all those cases, you are the one who made these choices; you are the one who is responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>Accountability is also about measurement—how many times you went for a run, how many sculptures you've completed, how many words you wrote. The point of measurement is not to find a perfect metric but to reduce uncertainty—to have something to track that is close to reality. Following the time you've spent on skill practice is far from being ideal, but it's okay for indicating how well or poorly we were at learning.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-week">Perfect week</h2>
<p>It's Sunday evening, and I'm sitting on a couch, thinking about the upcoming week - what I plan to achieve and how much time I need to spend on practicing different skills. I have an idea about a certain amount of hours that have to be spent every week to progress, and I aim for that number every week.</p>
<p>We all have those numbers - how many times we should visit the gym, the minimum number of pages we need to write to meet a deadline, or the number of exercises that should be practiced with a musical instrument. Targets should exist so we can align our lives with them, but failing to meet them should never be considered a failure.</p>
<p>If your plan was to hit the gym three times a week, but you only managed to go once, it's tempting to say that you've failed. When you visit the gym only twice the following week, you may start to experience the first signs of doubt: <code>I have no willpower to keep my own promise, maybe I'm not capable of it at all</code>. After a few more weeks, giving up on the whole idea becomes an option.</p>
<p>When you set a goal for the week, you often plan it as if everything will be perfect. You schedule specific days and times, envision how long each exercise will take, and determine how many you'll do. You'll also assume that nothing in your surroundings will change and that nothing will interfere with your goals.</p>
<p>We don't live in isolation; life happens, and it can negatively impact our goals. You might become injured, find that your gym is closed, car have a flat tire, have a night with no sleep, or encounter any other nasty surprises that life is rich with. Unfortunately, it's not always balanced, and compensation rarely comes. I'm still waiting for that unexpected day off when I'll be able to squeeze in an extra training session.</p>
<p>When you set a goal for the week, make it explicit: what would be a perfect week? Then, strive to achieve that by doing everything you can - reschedule missing practice sessions, compromise, rearrange your schedule or wake up at 5 AM if needed.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, see how close you are to reaching your goal. Did you achieve it? That's awesome - you've reached perfection. If you reached only 80% of it, that's a great result as perfection is hardly achievable and life can interfere, so it's perfectly fine. Made it only to 10%? 10% of perfection sounds not that bad, next week there would be another attempt.</p>
<p>Reaching a perfect goal shouldn't be easy. If you're achieving it every week, your aim may be set too low. However, it should be attainable with hard effort. Start with an educated guess and see if you can reach it. Don't hesitate to adjust it as you go along. We grow, our lives and environments change constantly, and so does our image of a perfect goal.</p>
<h1 id="treats">Treats</h1>
<p>Ultra running is physically tough, but the main battle is mental - you need to keep going no matter how bad you feel. Anything that can ease the mental pressure is worth using. One such thing is to carry a treat - something that you enjoy eating - and use it at the right moment. It may sound like a small and unimportant detail, but sometimes even the slightest support is what we need to be able to continue.</p>
<p>Treat yourself - buy the signature drumsticks of your favorite drummer, get a new running cap because it looks beautiful, or find a 100-year-old typewriter to place on a table where you write. These things are not going to affect your skill level in any way, but they will support your new identity and make you feel better.</p>
<p>Buying new things should never become your goal, and by all means, avoid setting a prize for your effort. <code>If I run 100km in a week, then I'll buy myself new sneakers</code> may sound like a good motivation boost, but in reality, it will crush your desire for running. If we love running, then how can an additional prize on top can demotivate us?</p>
<p>When you go for a run, you do it because it makes you feel good and happy. When there is a prize at the end, your focus shifts to earning it, and you start running for that prize. Rarely does a pair of new sneakers motivate us more than the feeling of happiness and joy.</p>
<p>You may be sitting and enjoying solving a puzzle, and someone offers you a dollar to solve it, and suddenly the fun is gone. Don't take the fun away from yourself. Go and buy an ice cream after the training because you want to treat yourself, but never do the training for the ice cream. And don't overuse it - it's not a treat anymore if you use it every day.</p>
<h2 id="getting-back">Getting back</h2>
<p>Before my first ultramarathon, I thought the main thing was to keep running and reach the finish line as fast as I could. It turns out that on longer distances and complex terrains, it's impossible to run all the time. People switch to walking, and some spend most of their time slowly but steadily moving toward the finish line.</p>
<p>On my first 100km race, I was able to run for only 5 hours, followed by another 19 hours of slow walking until I reached the finish line. That day, I became convinced that the key is to keep walking - as long as I keep moving, I can reach the finish line.</p>
<p>It took a year and another unfinished, given-up race to realize what the key thing actually is. It's not about how fast we go, whether running or walking. It's not even about constantly moving forward because there will come a time when we stop, exhausted and unable to move. The main thing is to get back on track and continue.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter that much how fast you are progressing with the skill you are trying to master. It's such a long journey that another year means little. If you decide to master quantum physics and contribute to humanity's knowledge about it, then it hardly matters if it takes 20 or 25 years — what matters is that you will do it one day.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate, but expected if you stop in the middle. Ask anyone with a Ph.D. about their lowest point, and you will hear stories of desperation in moments when hope was lost. Well-known books were in the garbage bin when disappointed writers thought there was no point in continuing. </p>
<p>It's not the moment when we stop that we give up, but we give up by not getting back afterwards. All the abandoned places and dreams were not created in the moment when people left them; they continue to exist because people didn't come back.</p>
<p>It's not important that you stopped playing the piano ten years ago; what matters is your decision to start doing it again.</p>
<h2 id="boredom">Boredom</h2>
<p>Non-runners have trouble understanding how someone can enjoy a 3-hour run without getting bored. Those who don't read cannot comprehend how someone can be excited about holding a new 800-page book; it may appear rather dull and intimidating. Classical music is simply uninteresting, and it's challenging to grasp how others can enjoy it.</p>
<p>Interest comes from understanding nuances - from the little details that are invisible to outsiders but bring joy to those who can see them.</p>
<p>Every sculpture begins with a piece of clay in your hand, but you may find yourself delving deep into human anatomy, holding a human atlas, and discovering the complexity of our ears. Drumming might start as a fun way to hit things with sticks, then learning about double pedal techniques and realising that legs has to be developed as well as your arms.</p>
<p>In learning new skills, we constantly discover these nuances and can learn and practice them. This makes each practice session different and interesting. It slightly shifts the direction of our learning and creates novelty. To outsiders, it may seem like we're doing the same thing, but for us, it's an entirely new world where everything is new and exciting. To stay engaged, embrace the nuances of your craft and dive deep into every small detail.</p>
<p>Change direction and explore new possibilities. Do crazy things because they're incredibly fun. Read about how the old masters practiced their crafts and do it like in ancient times - run barefoot, sculpt with clay by the lake's shore, play drums using only your hands. Or embrace the future by trying out air drumming, digital sculpture, or indoor virtual running.</p>
<p>Maintain novelty by going outside your craft to gain better support for it. Learn music theory if you're a drummer, learn painting if you're a sculptor, or learn sculpture if you're an artist. This enables you to gain a different perspective, view your craft from a new angle, and discover previously invisible nuances.</p>
<p>Many ultra running races take place in beautiful locations, where runners enjoy the sights of forests, mountains, waterfalls or deserts. One day I discovered a different kind of challenge: the 24-hour races that happens on a 400-meter running track. In these races, runners complete hundreds of loops, over and over again, beginning in the morning, running throughout the day, and continuing through the night until the sun rises again.</p>
<p>I decided to run a 50 km race on a running track to see if I get insane or dizzy because of all this circular motion. I spent a month training on the track to get used to that. To make it more fun, I chose to do the run at midnight on a Friday. The run went well, expectedly I was completely exhausted by the end and could barely walk. When I was coming back home I realised that it feels like I'm 20 years again - coming home after a Friday night party and having troubles walking straight. This unique experience will stay with me forever and so as love for running.</p>
<p>Embrace the nuances, learn and change every small detail of your craft and you will never be bored.</p>

<h2 id="mastering-system">Mastering system</h2>
<p><code>Mastering System</code> is a comprehensive overview of long-term skill development. It seeks to answer the main question: <code>Why do we give up?</code> and explores what helps us to keep going. There are numerous books about skill development and interviews with top-of-the-field masters, and this book incorporates wisdom from those. What sets this book apart, is not only the description of the system but also an app that utilizes all the information from the book.</p>
<p>You can use this book on its own and simply apply advices and strategies in your daily life, or you can give <a href="https://www.qqself.com/">qqself</a> a try.</p>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>All my life, I've hated running because I was terrible at it, but here I am finishing my very first 100 kilometers ultra-running race. I can barely walk, and the whole event feels more like ultra-crawling. I didn't expect what it would be, and I made all the possible mistakes. If someone were to tell you that ultra-running is a fun adventure full of joy, then it's a lie - it's about discomfort, pain, and suffering.</p>
<p>There is no joy in it. You can feel it only in the very first 10 minutes of the run when you start. And then after you cross the finish line. And then for about a week, even when you can still barely move, every moment of your existence is filled with a feeling of accomplishment and pure happiness. And then, any time you remember that race, you feel proud, knowing what you've achieved.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery in any skill is a long journey with thousands of hours of exhausting practice near your limits, which is far away from being called joyful. We are happy to do that because of what it brings us - a feeling of getting better, a feeling of accomplishment, and the ability to do what was impossible before.</p>
<p>Every skill, every master, and every scholar are unique, yet there are common reasons why novices give up just after they've started. There is a common issue of plateau when you seem to be no longer progressing, and many more issues that arise in front of everyone on the way to mastery of every skill. </p>
<p>There are numerous books and reports from the best masters that we can learn from - what strategies musicians use to perfect their skill; what strategies writers use to focus on their work and avoid distraction of the daily life; what keeps us motivated and how to deal with the failures. All the is the <code>Mastering System</code>.</p>
<h2 id="dream">Dream</h2>
<p>At the start of the ultra running race, everyone is nervous and excited about the adventure that lies in front of them. You stand there in the crowd, feeling motivated to show your best, experiencing fear about what awaits you, and full of doubt about whether you can actually do it or not.</p>
<p>Ultra running, in essence, is all about crossing a finish line - enduring 20, 30, or even 40 hours of suffering, experiencing ups and downs, feeling exhausted, pushing your physical limits, and being torn between two conflicting desires: the willingness to finish no matter what, and the urge to end the pain, give up, and return back to comfortable and easy life.</p>
<p>Depending on the race's difficulty, ranging from 15% to up to 50%, runners will give up and never reach the finish line. It's almost impossible to become so exhausted, to reach such a physical state where you actually cannot take another step - our brains give up much sooner than that. When that happens, &quot;I am a failure and not a runner&quot; is the only thought that fills your mind; it's a crushing feeling that I've experienced myself many times.</p>
<p>Time goes by, you rest for a few days, and you start to regret that you gave up too soon. You wish you could have held on a bit longer; maybe you could have recovered and finished the race. What you never have regrets about is the run itself. Regardless of how much suffering you went through, regardless of whether you gave up or crossed the finish line, you are glad that you tried.</p>
<p>From all those who stand at a starting line, many are going to give up along the way, but there are many more who gave up before and never allowed themselves to start.</p>
<p>We tend to underestimate what could be achieved in the long term. In 10-20 years, you could become a completely different person if you wish to be. You could become a musician, a writer, an athlete, an artist, or a scientist working to cure cancer. It might sound crazy right now to even think about it, but this thought is only crazy now. </p>
<p>Think about how much you've changed between the ages of 10 and 20. From 20 to 30? There are hardly any similarities between those two phases, and the same could happen again if you are willing to make it so.</p>
<p>We all have our own limits, obstacles, and environments that don't allow us to make an immediate change, but these factors shouldn't limit what you dream about. Allow yourself to dream; forget about limits - if you want to terraform Mars, then let it be. There is no path to mastery without desire, and there is no desire without a dream. Allowing yourself to dream is like coming to the starting line of a race - it's giving yourself a chance to finish.</p>
<p>Mastery takes decades to reach; it's a long journey in which very few succeed. The chances of crossing the finish line are low, but you will be glad that you tried.</p>
<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>Feeling of progress is the main motivator in skill learning. You become better, unlock things that were not possible before, and see the results of your practice and training. When progress is invisible, it's hard to continue putting effort into learning.</p>
<p>In some skills, the hardest part is the beginning. With musical instruments, at first, you'll be making sounds instead of music. Going to the gym in the first few months will result in muscle pain rather than muscle growth. Pursuing art will yield ugliness, rather than beauty.</p>
<p>There might be no clear markers of progress. This is a main reason why newcomers often give up in the beginning—they see no results from their efforts. It's also why people who have been practicing a skill for many years can hardly understand why newcomers quit. When you've reached advanced levels of the skill, it continues to deliver results: you earn medals for race participations, have new sculptures on a shelf, or add learned songs to your repertoire.</p>
<p>There is one metric that keeps progressing, regardless of your skill level or the type of skill you're practicing: time. Time spent on skill practice is the best indicator for beginners to have a sense of progress. Setting arbitrary goals like spending 5 hours a week in the gym, achieving a total of 50 hours there, or reaching 200 hours of running per year can create a strong sense of progress until the skill itself starts showing it.</p>
<p>Not all time spent is equal, and time spent is not a perfect indicator—optimizing this metric might lead to spending a lot of time in the gym doing nothing. It's not a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that your company needs to optimize. It's a number that you measure, not one you optimize. It's a number for yourself alone, not a public figure you share on social networks.</p>
<p>The lack of a feeling of progress can affect not only newcomers. In fact, when you've reached more advanced levels, most of the time is spent on a plateau. This can be even more frustrating than for newcomers, as you put more effort into pushing your limits, yet mastery might seem farther away than you can achieve. One way to break through such plateaus is patience, time, and deliberate practice.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice involves focusing on your weakest points and working towards improving them.</p>
<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>
<p>Many know how to rest, but few know how to recover. To keep moving and getting better day after day, year after year we have to learn how to recover. </p>
<p>Rest means not doing an activity, while recovery means doing something that help us get energy back and be ready to practice again. Lying on a sofa is a rest, but it's not really recovering. Actually, just lying on a sofa can be a way to recover, and it's actually quite difficult to do – just lying there without holding a phone or watching TV.</p>
<p>Many times, when we feel tired, we turn to things that entertain us: games, Netflix or watching cats on YouTube. Watching cats can be relaxing and definitely entertaining, but it doesn't help us to recover and doesn't restore our mental energy levels. Almost any kind of consumption requires cognitive effort and doesn't give our brain a proper break.</p>
<p>Some skills require physical recovery, but all skills require the restoration of mental energy. We skip training not because we physically cannot get to the gym, but because we cannot convince ourselves to go there. When our mental capacity is exhausted, we feel like we've lost motivation and interest in doing things – all because we've failed to give our brain a chance to recover.</p>
<p>In our modern world, filled with many distractions, we need to consciously make an effort to give our brains a break from constant stimulation.</p>
<p>Sleep is the most effective way to recover, and a full night of sleep have the greatest impact on energy levels. When you read about masters or scholars who have gone through intense learning, you may find that daily naps mentioned frequently. </p>
<p>Activities like meditation, taking a walk outside, reading a book, taking shower or even simply sitting quietly can provide an effective recovery. Being lost in doing music or art can provide an effective way to recover as well.</p>
<p>When feeling tired don't rest - recover. </p>
<h2 id="consumption">Consumption</h2>
<p>If you decide to watch all &quot;getting started for runners&quot; videos, you'll die before you go for a first run. You can find an answer on any question you have and this is what we, as a humanity, have gifted to ourselves. You can explore new skills, get inspired, find instructions, training plans or race reports. Lack of information is not a problem anymore - we can find information about any skill and start learning it from any point in the world.</p>
<p>We can watch races and competitions, see interviews with masters and sometimes get so close to them and observe how they work and live in real time. </p>
<p>Watching others may inspire us, we can learn from it and we can become better at doing. But sometimes watching others makes us do less. You may have a need, a desire to satisfy: willingness to move, to go for a run, idea of a new project or emotion that you want to express yourself in art. Watch a video how others do that and your brain will be satisfied, the need will become less strong or disappear completely. Watching how others do sports decreases a willingness to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Watch an adventure movie, all the emotions: desire to explore the unknowns, curiosity, novelty, fear and excitement, satisfaction in the end, will be real, but actually you've been laying down on a sofa without moving for 2 hours. </p>
<p>Watching how others are doing things makes us compare. You watch how people running in a desert, on top on volcano or in Amazon jungles and then having a run in the forest close to you become boring. You want to make a sculpture, to express yourselves, to capture your emotions in clay, but after watching few videos of other better sculptors, you see clearly that you are not as good as them and motivation is shuttered. </p>
<p>Watching others doing things may have a negative impact on feeling our identities. Writing a book makes you feel more as a writer; feeling more as a writer makes you write more. But when we watch interviews with top writers about their new released book we may feel doubt about ourselves - maybe I am not a writer? </p>
<h2 id="identities">Identities</h2>
<p>If you Google &quot;How to write a book?&quot; you'll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps.</p>
<p>Our daily life is full of choices, and having an identity helps us to choose. Being a sculptor is not only about spending time handling clay in your hands—it's also about learning how to see things, noticing beauty (or horrors and creepiness for some of us) in existing art. If you are a writer, then planning to spend a Friday evening in the library sounds great because that's what writers do. Being a drummer means listening to music becomes an active experience where you carefully listen to how drums are used in the song. Identities guide us in the right directions and keep us aligned with long-term goals.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to fail at an identity. If you are a runner but didn't run for half of the year because of an injury, you are still a runner. If you just wrote your first 10 pages, you are a writer -not a good one yet, but a writer on the way to become better.</p>
<p>Identities work much better in the long run. Compare it to the common New Year resolution: Some may decide to write one page every day, but then life happens, and one day is lost. The plan has failed; it's not every day anymore, and giving up on the whole idea becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>Reaching mastery is always full of terrible mistakes and wrong turns. You may be playing the piano for a long time and one day realize that you have the wrong hand posture. Or doing sculpture and realizing that progress is impossible unless you spend a lot of time learning human anatomy. These may become the lowest points where you are demotivated, lost, and hopeless. Having an identity helps in such cases—it's like a compass that shows you a direction. You would still need time to bypass a sudden obstacle, but it will ensure you get back on track.</p>
<p>Decide who you want to become, write it down, and put it somewhere where you will see it many times a day. Sometimes it's best to put it somewhere where no one else can see it. It's hard to write &quot;Iron Man Triathlete&quot; if you've been a couch potato all your life and afraid that people may laugh at it. Hide it for now; it's temporary, and one day you'll wear those Iron Man cap, bag, and other swag on a daily basis, showing others who you've become.</p>

<h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
<p>Failures are the main reason why we give up. It could be just in the beginning where we start learning new skill with high expectations only to be crushed by the it's difficulty. Or when you become good at it, after years of practice, realising that it's impossible to be as good as masters. </p>
<p>Failures is like a cruel teacher that punishes you when you make mistake and fills us with doubt about our ability to continue. It might seem like a curse to have a teacher like that, but despite its archaic methods, its goal is to teach you. </p>
<p>Failures are just pointers to our weakest points: To some part of our skill that needs correction or enhancement. To the part or our skill that limits us, something which, when improved, will allow us to reach a new level and unlock capabilities that wasn't possible before.</p>
<p>To learn the lesson, there is one thing we need to do: to reflect on it. What exactly had happened and what mistakes did we make? What exactly is the weakest point that surfaced and caused the failure? Write it all down, think about your failure and by doing it you'll grow.</p>
<p>We make mistakes and recover in every skill all the time. In writing, it's more explicit than ever: the very first sentence we write is always ugly, and sometimes it's physically painful to observe how poorly we've expressed a thought on paper. It's surprising that we have ever written anything before; it's obvious that even a 2-year-old can express their thoughts in a clearer way. We delete the sentence and rewrite it, only to end up with a slightly better version of it. It's still embarrassing, but we keep going - deleting and rewriting, editing and making it clearer - until it becomes okay. By all literature standards, it's still bad, but something good starting to appear. The first version, which was nothing but a failure, transforms into something valuable and worthy.</p>

In qqself you have a journal where you write about you skill practices and can reflect about it: Comment how did you feel during a training, what exactly you've practiced or analyse what kind of mistakes did you do which requires attention.
</div></p>

</div>
<p>Failures also come in the form of broken plans. They could arise from mistakes due to our lack of skill, but mistakes could also be hidden within the plan itself.</p>
<p>Everyone who starts an ultra-running race has a plan. These races could last up to 40 hours, presenting numerous opportunities for things to go wrong, not in accordance with the plan. Realizing that you are 3 hours behind your intended schedule will crush your motivation and likely make you to give up. A common strategy is to have three plans.</p>
<p>The first plan assumes perfect execution—when you are performing at your best, pushing the boundaries of your capabilities, and achieving a new personal best. Since our brains tend to overestimate, the very first plan that comes to mind is usually this ideal one. When we imagine the outcomes of a new project or challenge, we often assume perfect execution. Don't fight against this; instead, accept it and make it explicit that this plan is for when luck is on your side and everything goes perfectly.</p>
<p>The second plan accepts imperfections. There will be unpleasant surprises, unexpected turns, things will be harder that what you've expected, and moments when your performance falls short of your previous best.</p>
<p>Third plan is when you left you luck at home. It's for situations when the weather is at its worst, the terrain is terrible, and your body refuses to cooperate. Generally, third plan is simply about crossing a finish line.</p>
<p>Having three plans addresses the issue of a wrong expectations and overestimation. This approach keeps your goals more aligned with reality. When you fail to achieve your objectives according to the first plan, it doesn't mean total failure; you've just failed of executing it perfectly. You can then shift to the second plan and keep going. Often, things will align with the second plan. However, there are times when misfortune persists and mistakes continue to happen. This is when the third plan comes into play—when conditions are terrible, yet you persist in reaching the finish line no matter what.</p>
<h2 id="pacing">Pacing</h2>
<p>If you begin running at a speed that you cannot maintain throughout the entire race, you will hit a wall before reaching the finish line. You'll feel a fire in your lungs, and your legs will be consumed by pain. In running, burning out is explicit and, in a sense, quite literal.</p>
<p>Mastery takes decades to reach, and correct pacing protects us from burning out and stopping in the middle. We are all capable of sprinting—maintaining a high speed for a short time that is followed by a complete body collapse and the need for recovery. You uncover the beauty and novelty of a new skill; you dedicate every evening to it, only to grow tired and fed up with it after a few weeks or months.</p>
<p>Correct pacing is difficult to find and only comes through the experience of failures resulting from choosing incorrectly. Opting for a pace that is too fast is a common mistake that can occur among both novice learners and more advanced scholars.</p>
<p>If you're feeling demotivated and have lost interest in a skill - slow down or take a break. Reflect on the amount of time you've practiced that skill in the last week/month/year, and compare it to previous periods. If you've spent 30 hours on your favourite musical instrument this month, but typically it's 20 hours, it's not surprising that you're feeling tired. If you usually write for 1 hour per day, but suddenly find yourself immersed for 3 hours, the next day's writing might seem unappealing, and it's going to be hard to find the motivation to write even a few sentences. Instead of getting upset or feeling guilty about a sudden break, accept it – you've been moving too fast and need to slow down.</p>
<p>Run too slow and guilt will be running along. You used to write 10 pages per day, but now found time to write 10 pages in a whole week. You've visited gym 3 times a week, this week you hit only once. In all those cases, we would feel guilt: not doing what we're supposed to, progressing slowly, and not giving our all.</p>
<p>Accept it - it's part of the life and no one goes without such obstacles and drops. Every week is a new, and every Monday start it all over again. Start it from the scratch without weight of the past - it doesn't matter how little you do week before, you only have this week. </p>
<p>Allow yourself to start over.</p>
<h2 id="accountability">Accountability</h2>
<p>Reaching mastery is your own personal journey—you are the only one who wants it, the only one who can achieve it, and the only one responsible for it. Be honest with yourself. If you dream of learning how to fly a plane but have done absolutely nothing towards it over a year, then it's a decision you've made. You are in charge of the entire process, and every decision (or lack thereof) is yours and yours alone. Don't lie to yourself - every day is filled with choices and you are the only one who is choosing.</p>
<p>Accountability means honesty. If the plan was to hit the gym three times a week, but in reality, you hardly visit it weekly, then be honest—you visit the gym once a week. There are always obstacles; there's always a lack of time. Sometimes, however, you can certainly recall when you found a solution: you woke up earlier, you compromised, and you found a way through. Other times, you didn't even try and accepted whatever was given to you. In all those cases, you are the one who made these choices; you are the one who is responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>Accountability is also about measurement—how many times you went for a run, how many sculptures you've completed, how many words you wrote. The point of measurement is not to find a perfect metric but to reduce uncertainty—to have something to track that is close to reality. Following the time you've spent on skill practice is far from being ideal, but it's okay for indicating how well or poorly we were at learning.</p>

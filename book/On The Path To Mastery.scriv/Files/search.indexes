            <Title>Capabilities</Title>
            <Text>The goal of learning and practicing is to expand our capabilities, allowing us to do something we cannot do now. It’s a transformation we undergo: we choose something that seems impossible, and then, through hard work, we make it achievable. Every time we become capable of something new, we open a door that leads us to a world that was previously locked. It is a reward that keeps us motivated to continue practicing.

By practicing running uphill, you make it possible to participate in ultrarunning races happening in the Alps, Andes, and Himalayas mountain ranges. Learning how to free dive unlocks the experience of swimming with whales in the deep ocean. Learning to play the drums for old rock songs allows you to join a cover band and spend Friday evenings playing live in a local bar. By learning how to create concrete sculptures using cement, you would have a chance to participate in a city contest for the opportunity to place your sculpture in a local park. Winning is not the point; you’ve already won by making yourself capable of competing with other sculptors.

Not all capabilities are directly related to a certain skill but can provide great support for it. If you develop the habit of waking up at 6 AM, you’ll be able to fit in a training or a learning session in the morning while the whole world is still asleep. By eliminating the main sources of distraction in your life, you’ll lead a more focused life, and your learning sessions will be more effective.

We can acquire new capabilities by buying it. Getting a backpack with a tent and sleeping bag unlocks the ability to spend a night in the wilderness, enabling us to undertake multi-day runs. Purchasing a drum set unlocks the capability of becoming a drummer. Obtaining a human anatomy atlas provides you with the ability to create a more accurate representation of the human body in your sculptures.

Through practice and skill development, we build confidence and courage, which are capabilities in their own. They enables us to take on more significant challenges and set targets beyond our current limits, ultimately leading to even greater progress in our skills.

Expanding capabilities through skill practice is an infinite process of turning the impossible into the possible. If you continue for long enough, the word “impossible” will lose its meaning and become synonymous with word “hard”.</Text>

            <Title>Dream</Title>
            <Text>It was 5 minutes before the midnight, I was waiting on a start line on my very first 100 km ultra running marathon. At the start of the race, everyone is nervous and excited about the adventure that lies in front of them. I was standing there in the crowd, feeling motivated to show my best, experiencing fear about what awaits me, and full of doubt about whether I can actually do it or not.

Ultra running, in essence, is all about crossing a finish line - enduring 20, 30, or even 40 hours of suffering, experiencing ups and downs, feeling exhausted, pushing your physical limits, and being torn between two conflicting desires: the willingness to finish no matter what, and the urge to end the pain, give up, and return back to comfortable and easy life.

Depending on the race’s difficulty, ranging from 15% to up to 50%, runners will give up and never reach the finish line. It’s almost impossible to become so exhausted, to reach such a physical state where you actually cannot take another step - our brains give up much sooner than that. When that happens, “I am a failure and not a runner” is the only thought that fills the mind; it’s a crushing feeling that I’ve experienced myself.

After such failure, you rest for a few days, and then start to regret that you gave up too soon. You wish you could have held on a bit longer; maybe you could have recovered and finished the race. What you never have regrets about is the run itself. Regardless of how much suffering you went through, regardless of whether you gave up in the end - you are glad that you tried.

From all those who stand at a starting line, many are going to give up along the way, but there are many more who gave up before and never allowed themselves to start.

We cannot start a path to mastery if we never allowed ourselves to dream about it - to accept that it’s possible. When we imagine how the future may look like, we limit our imagination based on what we have right now. We imagine slightly better version of ourselves - a 1 or 2 steps higher in the corporate ladder, a bit more money on our account, slightly stronger and better at things we do now. We dream based on who we are right now, rather than based on who we want to become.

We tend to underestimate what could be achieved in the long term. In 10–20 years, you could become a completely different person if you wish to be. You could become a musician, a writer, an athlete, an artist, or a scientist working to cure cancer. It might sound crazy right now to even think about it, but this thought is only crazy now.

Think about how much you’ve changed between the ages of 10 and 20. From 20 to 30? There are hardly any similarities between those phases, and the same could happen again if you are willing to make it so.

Growing up, we notice that some things are easier than others. You may be good at math and computers, while others can talk to people easily. As we become adults, we choose professions related to the things we do well, and after some time, our minds become fixed: I'm good at it because I have been good at it all my life. I cannot become good at anything else.

We don’t allow ourselves to even think about trying new things unless, by some magic, we are already good at them. We think that a natural gift is a requirement for entry. The existence of talent is questionable, and Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool describe it well in Peak that it’s not some magical ability we are born with, but rather the result of our environment when we are young and a product of grit and practice for those who have reached mastery.

It’s hard to rewire our minds, and it may take a long time to convince ourselves that talent is not needed to start a path toward any kind of mastery. Fine, talent does exist; there are people with gifts from the time they are born, and you have it for only a few skills. Think of talent as a multiplier of your effort - if you have a gift, then all your effort is multiplied by 110%. For skills in which you have no natural talent, the modifier is 90% - it would take a longer time to reach a certain level of mastery. The numbers are arbitrary, but the point is, the absence of a natural gift only affects the speed at which you progress. If the path to mastery takes 20 years for some and 25 years for others, it’s hardly a reason not to try.

	•	I'm not good with music - said by someone who has never tried any musical instrument
	•	I'm bad at art - said by someone who has never learned it
	•	I'm a bad swimmer - saying one who has never trained

We are supposed to be bad at things we’ve never practiced. It should never be a reason for not allowing ourselves to dream about them and try them.

We all have our own limits, obstacles, and environments that don’t allow us to make an immediate change, but these factors shouldn’t limit what we dream about. Allow yourself to dream; forget about limits - if you want to terraform Mars, then let it be your dream. There is no path to mastery without desire, and there is no desire without a dream. Allowing yourself to dream is like coming to the starting line of a race - it’s giving yourself a chance to finish.

Allow yourself to dream - dreaming permits imagination without limits. Limits exists and learning is an only way to remove such limits, but dream is a first step to be able to set a goal.

Mastery takes decades to reach; it’s a long journey in which very few succeed. The chances of crossing the finish line are low, but you will be glad that you tried.</Text>

            <Title>Discovery</Title>
            <Text>There are millions of fulfilling activities that you can start doing, which will bring passion and meaning to your life. It’s there, waiting for you, but you cannot start doing it until you know that it exists first. Most likely, all the things you’ve already discovered in your life happened by themselves - a random video, book, or article that got you interested in a new hobby; a friend mentioned something, or parents drove you to try new things. Discovery is a product of chance and luck, but there are a few things we can do to improve our chances.

We are surrounded by new opportunities that we hardly notice in our daily lives because of our mindset. To streamline discoveries, we need to adopt an experimentation mindset. It’s all about trying new things, hoping that they will guide us somewhere, and being ready for the possibility that most will bring nothing. Experimentation assumes uncertainty and a lack of confidence that we will end up with success, and sometimes an experiment is simply a case of let's try and see what happens. Don’t ignore opportunities to try something new just because you’re not sure if you’re going to like it - dive in and decide afterward.

During a discovery, ignore pretty much all the limits that you can think of. You are not committing to spending the next 20 years doing it, but just trying things out. If flying a helicopter sounds interesting, then start exploring what it means - what courses are available, buy a book, watch a getting started video, and install a simulator. Ignore the fact that you have no talent, no experience, and no possibilities. The goal here is to discover what you like; multi-year planning on how to become a master at it is a task for later.

Ignore social norms, your environment, your friends, and even your own beliefs - these will prevent you from trying things that deep down you are actually interested in. If you are a big guy who can bench press 300 kg and cannot believe you are attracted to doll dress crafting, then be a man and do what you actually want, not what society assumes or wants you to do.

Ignore long-forgotten past experiences. If the last time you exercised was in school and the memories still hurt, consider that such experiences are outdated and should be set aside. If your parents forced you to play the piano 20 years ago and you still hate it, let this feeling go. Your environment is different now; no one is forcing you, and you can play whatever you want. Your passion for music might not have been present when you were a child, but it may have emerged within you by now. You are different now - your interests, knowledge, and past experiences have changed you. I was terrible at running in school, carrying a hate for it until I turned 33 when I gave it another try and fell in love with ultra marathons.

Ignore outliers and pretty much the top 1% - those are not representative of what is common. If you watch heavyweight women weightlifting from the last Olympics or the winners of the Boston Marathon, you may be discouraged by how people look and assume that those sports are not for you. Top performers sacrifice everything not related to their main craft to achieve unbelievable results, but that doesn’t mean you need to do the same. You can enjoy weightlifting without losing a feminine appearance and becoming bulky, and you can run marathons without becoming too slim.

In fact, during a discovery, ignore everything that is negative. Very likely, being an outsider, you are wrong about it. Martial arts are not about aggression and violence, parkour is not only for fit teens, pole dancing is not only about entertainment, and trampolines are not just for kids.

Avoid doing any cost-benefit analysis. If you start thinking that forging and becoming a blacksmith has less potential than costume design in terms of future profit, you’re not going far with that. If the idea of working with liquid metal appeals to you, then go for it; it will drive you far. If you decide to do something only because of the potential future money, you are going to give up much sooner than you expect.

In our world, we live in a bubble surrounded by personalised recommendations. Social networks, YouTube, Netflix, and others show us things related to what we are already aware of. Most of the digital content we consume is uniquely tailored, selected, and prepared only for us. These recommendations are personalised based on what we have consumed in the past and what has a higher chance of being consumed. If you are interested in endurance sports, then YouTube will show you things related to that topic. It works great if we want to find good content, but it’s completely opposite to discovery, where novelty plays the most important role.

Friends' recommendations are also personalised and don’t differ much from YouTube in this sense. I’ll recommend something to my friend only if I assume she is going to like it, and my assumption of what she likes is based on past history and what I know about her. I’ll show something to her only when I assume there is a high chance for her to like it, in another words, consume - not much different from how Twitter recommendations work.

Recommendations remain a crucial tool. While the internet offers lists of countless hobbies, navigating through over a thousand items is unlikely to yield good results. What we need is to move away from personalised recommendations—those tailored specifically for you. We must break out of our own bubble.

Personal recommendations function primarily in the digital realm, and everything outside of it works better for discovery. Libraries, offline exhibitions, bookstores, and nearly any other brick-and-mortar store, such as sports shops, musical instrument stores, hobby shops, knitting stores, building supply shops, second-hand stores, or anything in between, offer valuable opportunities. Books, magazines, places where you can rent equipment, and areas where numerous courses are available serve as excellent avenues for exploration.

What you need to look for has to be real. In libraries, bookshops, movies, magazines, ignore the fiction department altogether and go directly to the non-fiction part. I love fantasy books with all my heart, but reading them has almost no chance of sparking the desire to learn archery or master a sword fight. This happens because, being fiction, the story is detached from reality, and even if things are part of our world, like archery, the context makes it difficult to recognise them in this way.

On the other hand, reading a non-fiction historical book about Middle Age blacksmiths or learning about historical reenactment with a description of how to reconstruct the uniform and muskets from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, including why there were drummers on the battlefield, may inspire you to try many different things that may not even be directly related to the topic you are reading about.

The goal in consuming such content is to focus on your emotions. Look carefully at the following picture. Which parts create an emotional reaction? Is it the horse riding, the grass field, the armour, muskets, swords, the guy with the drums on the left, the fog from the cannon (want to create your own cannon?!), the beautiful costumes, or the amazing moustache? Which part of it sparks curiosity? Personally, the next book I’m going to borrow from the library will be about crafting hats.

Discovery thrives when we can explore different perspectives. If you are interested in sports, read a book about a famous sports athlete, then one about a professional coach, and later have a look at what the Ministry of Sport thinks about it all. Read books about stadium construction and sports equipment design. Explore how to teach kids to do sports and what it takes to create a sports course for the elderly. The point here is not to choose which part you like the most, but to notice even the smallest details that spark interest. You may enjoy the coaching aspect but realize that complex human interaction is not for you, leading you to discover a passion for training dogs. Gaining a perspective on the lives of the elderly may prompt the thought that art could improve their lives better than sports, inspiring you to create a course for it.</Text>

            <Title>Focus</Title>
            <Text>What would you advice to your friend if she starts to complain that it’s impossible to find time for everything that she wants to achieve and explore? It’s rather common to suggest to make a choice - choose one endeavour, stick to it and forget all other desires. Such advice unlikely to appeal to your friend as she was hoping for something slightly better - probably some magic spell or a sacred wisdom from the ancient book which will allow her to achieve everything.

But is actually an even a good advice to start with - focusing on only one thing? Taking it to the extreme and ignoring everything that is not related to your goal will likely bring you to the top of the field in a shortest amount of time - but at what cost? Only a very few are willing to sacrifice everything to achieve one.

Even if we follow common sense, set our priority straight, keep in mind what is essentials for us, remembering friends and family, but remain focusing on only one thing and closing ourselves from our own desires to explore other things - would it make us happy? You’ll reach the great results, but on a death bed wouldn’t you regret of fixating on a such small amount of things? Wouldn’t you regret of not even trying?

Every morning we wake up and spend a day making a million of choices and every time we have to compromise it feels like, probably not a failure, but not exactly a winning either. We planned to have a two hours training, but could fit only 45 minutes; We wanted to dedicate morning to writing, but turns our guests are coming and have barely time to read the notes.

We want many things in life, not one. Our desires keep crushing to each other, tearing our life apart, demanding us to dedicate our time to them like they are our small children and we are tired parent who’ve just returned home. You don’t choose one and focus in such situation, don’t you? You try to be present in all of them, jumping from one to another constantly switching, trying to compromise. It’s exhausting, it’s challenging, but it’s an only way which we wouldn’t have regrets about.

It’s fine to switch between different skills that you learn, dedicate a bit more of your time to the one and next week to switch back to another. It’s fine to skip the training to try a new things. It’s fine to start learning second musical instrument, without completing mastering previous one first. It’s acceptable to stop writing a book for a half of the year to focus on reading and research.

Have a look on startups - those young companies simply cannot allow themself to be not focused, and yet none of them only doing an iPhone app. They have to do marketing, customer support, quality testing, planning, accounting and bunch of other activities that are essentials. They likely do it terribly, they do it not enough, but they do all of those and move forward across different direction every time and so can you.

When you switch you don’t abandon what you’ve been doing before, but merely changing your focus. You may achieve mastery slower than others, but constant switching of activities would allow you to keep things novel for a longer amount of time and periodic breaks reduces chances of burn out.

Remain focused by doings things that are important for you. Deciding to have an art practice instead of going to the gym is great, replacing gym with McDonalds and Netflix is probably not.
 
Focus in not doing only one thing - focus is doing right things.

            <Title>Identities</Title>
            <Text>If you Google How to write a book? you’ll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps.

Our daily life is full of choices, and having an identity helps us to choose. Being a sculptor is not only about spending time handling clay in your hands—it’s also about learning how to see things, noticing beauty (or horrors and creepiness for some of us) in life. If you are a writer, then planning to spend a Friday evening in the library sounds great because that’s what writers do. Being a drummer means listening to music becomes an active experience where you carefully listen to how drums are used in the song. Identities guide us in the right directions and keep us aligned with long-term goals.

It’s almost impossible to fail at an identity. If you are a runner but didn’t run for half of the year because of an injury, you are still a runner. If you just wrote your first 10 pages, you are a writer - not a good one yet, but a writer on the way to become better.

Identities work much better in the long run. Compare it to the common New Year resolution: Some may decide to write one page every day, but then life happens, and one day is lost. The plan has failed; it’s not every day anymore, and giving up on the whole idea becomes a possibility.

Reaching mastery is always full of mistakes and wrong turns. You may be playing the piano for a long time and one day realize that you have the wrong hand posture. Or doing sculpture and realising that progress is impossible unless you spend a lot of time learning human anatomy. These may become the lowest points where you are demotivated, lost, and hopeless. Having an identity helps in such cases - it’s like a compass that shows you a direction. You would still need time to bypass a sudden obstacle, but it will ensure you get back on track.

Decide who you want to become, write it down, and put it somewhere where you will see it many times a day. Sometimes it’s best to put it somewhere where no one else can see it. It’s hard to write Iron Man Triathlete if you’ve been a couch potato all your life and afraid that people may laugh at it. Hide it for now; it’s temporary, and one day you’ll wear those Iron Man cap, bag, and other swag on a daily basis, showing others who you’ve become.</Text>

- Time expanding - triathlon may require 15 hours per week of training, but you have only 7 then take an existing training plan but expand it to two weeks. Idea is to follow the training plan anyway, but at the slower pace. It also has a benefit that we can squeeze more training kinds. Rather than do 2 main training per week, we can do 4 (different) main training per two weeks
- Short chapters feels like it got cut in a middle
- Book is a bit harsh and likely will appeal to men, but ignores or even contradicts with women point of view 
- However is an OK word, not sure why I've avoided that
- I'm a a coach. Another model could be I'm a coach of myself and I want teach my readers how to be effective in coaching ourselves
- The are many myths that people are believing in which prevents them from starting new things: Talent, old people learning difficulty and probably many more. We need to debunk those myths in order to unlock readers and 
- Coach has to be confident in himself, in it's practices, in it's learners, in the learning path. If we are not - asses why, find a reason and eliminate it by education, learning and practice
- Startups are pivoting so often, it's their mantra of failing fast, so can't we do the same at least in the discovery part?
- This story of I've been nothing, but now going up is annoying and banal. Same way avoid sounded too special
- Swear words looks dirty in the book, avoid and remove. Also avoid stating your emotions which are obvious. `I was dark time of my life` `and then one day everything changed` are such a cliche that should be avoided 
- A way to become more than you were yesterday
- What is the norm? We see outliners, top of the field and result of there effort - do we see the majority? Even in case with top performers do we see their struggles? Writers may rewrite tens of drafts and don't finish half of the books - if that is the norm, then probably one random failure or your struggle shouldn't be so much big of a deal?
- Dance with your fear
- Let it go your dream to freely progress toward it
	- Going forward without expectation - let go of sabotaging goal obsession
	- The more people spend fantasising about desired outcome the less effort they will put into pursuing them. Unrealistic perfection of imagined performance
- Mental toughness - explore the topic
- PIVOT
- Progress until Personal Best - it's only downhill from there, age, decay and thoughts about death
- Ultra-runners must have a broader definition of success because of the length, terrain, and conditions under which their events are held
- Performance is equal to your potential minus all the distractions
- Evidence - it would help us in the moment we face a new challenge, we look back and can get a confidence boost from there. We need to collect evidence, `I AM FINE` mantra
- `This Is Tough, But I Am Tougher`
- Wins across many domains, so that self-esteem has always something to climb on and failures in one domains are balanced with wins in others
- We tend to choose what is the most efficient way to progress ignoring how difficult would it be. Alternative strategy is to watch for both effectiveness and enjoyment
- Confidence
- environment
	- Environment defines what is the norm
	- People like to do what most of the people think it's a right thing to do - Bandwagon Bias" or "Herd Mentality"
	- Great environment are the ones that helps exploring new adjacent possibilities. Building bridges with other environments we can mix the ideas
	- We are product of the environment - your childhood surroundings greatly affected who you are today. We are 50% product of our genes and 50% of our environment
	- Environment may support bad behaviour and will make it hard or impossible a new one - it's fixed and resist the change that you want to make. It's also inertia
	- Environments may suck out attention, time and energy so that we have nothing left for our goals. Which part of our environment interfere with our long-term plans?
	- Environments are unique and so provides unique opportunities: story about stairs training on a cruise ship
	- Develop our own environment - bend it by your will
	- Switch the environments
	- `Cannot do it until...` is waiting for the perfect environment which will never come
	- Being aware about good environment helps - sometimes we simply don't know how good environment looks like
	- Sometimes bad things filling our environment as there are no good things. Concentrating on bringing more good stuff will fix it by itself
	- Environment is a source of desires, but it could be a fake one which under the hood you actually don't want: Ads, friends buying new phones. Such desires are external and unlikely to make us happy when realised 
	- Watching news expands our environment to the size bigger than it's actually is and distant events that actually has no direct may affect you. Bad - negative news, good - positive stories
	- Practicing skills creates a small, fully controlled environment where we cay disappear from hectic daily life
	- Good ideas needs something to attach to, something to be born from, something that triggers it's appearance. The more we extend our environment, our capabilities, our experience the more novel and interesting ideas start to appear. Ideas are mixture of what we went through, what we know about, what we are interested in currently
- control
	- Schedule provide a control
	- Control time and you control stress. If you control the situation, your life, your schedule and make a deliberate choice of doing things that you do, then you are in charge. Such feeling eliminates stress. Opposite situation when you feel helpless makes you suffer under the stress. But often it's about point of view - same situation may looks differently. We also may be not in charge of big events of our life, but some part of it we may control. Making a choice, having a choice means we are deciding, we are in charge, we control it
	- Self inflicted stress may happen because of domino effect - may start with delaying waking up for 5 minutes, accumulating during a day and then causing big troubles. Even things like being late for 5 minutes, may cause us missing breakfast, or eating it super fast, creates a vision that we've lost the control, that we are not in charge anymore and so whole day may happen that way. Doing things in the last minute causes us a lot of stress while doing it and all the time we've stressed about it before. Same feeling of the lost control which is stress by itself
	- Public speaking is about loosing control, participation in a race, first live play - fear of loosing control. Staying at home is safer. We may use learning as an escaping
	-  Idea that everything is about the effort gives us control. If it's about natural talent or gens then we hardly impact that, so no need to work harder, keep pushing or recover after the failure
	- Time - Everyone is trying to take ours time, if we don't control it they someone else will. Protect it, it's like a magic power that we can put in good use or present to loving ones. Time is precious.
	- With more experience we have more self-esteem related to the skill which acts as a buffer which allows us to tolerate longer durations of loosing of control 
- New week, new year, new period means also new me
- It takes a lot of time to survive - work, commute, dishes. It could take up all the time that you have without any growth. In day job there is little grow as you've been doing it for long and grow slowed down. New skill learning provides feeling of a grow
- Notion of `Forever Project` - if we imagine that it takes infinite amount of time to complete it and we would work infinite amount of time on it then does it really matter if we do X or Y first or spend extra time working on a perfect feature without a value? There are infinite amount of time, so there is no value exists in anything - value used to compare things, but with infinite amount of time value of everything is NaN, so we can do all without need to choose
- Fitness development is limited by the speed of the recovery
- If tired lower (take half) the volumes, but keep the intensity - same for pre-race, same for recovery period
- You can continue your behaviour, so long as you pay for your social harm (taxes) VS Do as what government told you. Cap-and-trade system motivates doing more good behaviour as the more you do, the better the profit
- Listening to the inner voice and ignoring value will bring you to the place of the most interesting places with maximum personal growth
- Mastery is not about the goal, but a direction
- More detailed reflection: Which part you are struggling with - those needs more attention. Where we are right now. Which learning techniques works well and which doesn't? What I should do the same next time and what should I do differently? Benefits comes in the long run, in short term there would be no benefit and just a hassle. You learn to go metacognitive - assess yourself from the side. Increases feeling of control and autonomy - you are in control of your learning. How to make learning more effective? Use self-distancing for the reflection: Reflect like it was done by someone else
	- Reflecting on what we learn leverage the potential to generalise and and new concepts generated 
- _stages of learning_ _model
	1. making mistakes without realising it
		2. No idea what are you doing, a lot of frustration, not clear what the goal is.
		3. Feedback should be general and limited, as specific one could not be understood
	2. making mistakes and noticing all of them. Realisation how much you don't know
		1. You are practicing more, but feel like getting worser - you've been doing it before, you've been not good no notice that
	3. less mistakes, but you still need to focus on it and keep doing the right things
	4. intuition and less conscious effort
		1. Feedback has to be very specific and targeted on weaknesses
- Natural talent: Affect on how fast you improve at the beginning VS how much you can reach in the end
- 3 things affects the learning: Natural gift, effort, learning effectiveness. You can control only last 2
- Premature optimisations - no need to spend time on a perfect gear if you are starting. Ask yourself is that the right time to optimise? Should you spend time on it now? What advantage will it give, if postponing what will be the consequences? What else could you do instead of optimising?
- Protege effect - explain to others what you've learned. Learn materials like you are going to teach others
- Reflect on mis-prediction: projection bias. Current state effect a lot our decisions and planning whatever short or long term. Think of past similar situation when mis-predication failed - why now is different?
- Think what you really want to do? Life time is limited. Helps to ask in 3rh person - why do you want me to do?
- To solve value-action-gap remind people about their values. Suggest concrete and easy action towards their values. make it harder to go against our values
- Nudge
	- Default option
	- anchor - most people donate 20$. So you think around this number
	- Make good options easier, bad options harder. Good more visible, bad more hidden
	- Informing people about information they don't know - reminding people about information that they know already
	- Reminding to do something
	- Getting people to slow down to avoid doing bad things
	- We are imperfect decision-makers who often act not rationally and not rational. Context affect our choices, so changing environment helps
	- Dual process memory: fast and slow. 
- Learned helplessness  - controllability, solved by control, but control has to be detected first. Long exposure to shock. We can learn it by exposure. Expectation of uncontrollability. Inability to control the outcome? Objective helplessness -&gt; subjective helplessness
	- Focus on what we can control
	- Negative outcome is not necessary meant that you did something wrong
		- Internal `I did bad`, vs external `it was a difficult situation`
	- Negative outcome has a limited affect on other areas of life and not a global failure
		- global `it's going to ruin my life` VS specific `it wont affect other areas of my life`
	- Negative outcome is permanent 
		- stable `this is not ever change` VS unstable `this will improve over time`
	- Failures are `external, specific, unstable`. Success are `internal, global, stable`
	- Positive reinforcement - positive feedback 
- Pareto - 20% of effort gives 80% of the results
- Self-distancing - allows to detach emotionally. Refer to themself in second-person (you) or by name (John). Promotes self-reflection. Better wise-reasoning when we make advice to others. Give perspective and evaluate experience like you are the couch or giving advice to the friend. Dialog
- Look forward and reason back
- To improve writing we need to go over your writing and find areas of improvement (OMG it means when I notice how bad my writings are then it's a way forward!). Feedback - share with audience, or measured one. Focus on why should be improved, rather than rush to change it
- When reading/seeing other masters that got you impressed - asked yourself why? Think hardly why it's good? Then practice those ideas in your craft. Do the same when you see something bad - think carefully why is that bad? What is missing and what should have been avoided?
- Periodically observe results from the past and see how much better you've become. Seeing mistakes in the past means you've grown in the craft
- Don't expect your first results to be perfect, it will be bad. Focus on getting something written down, later on you can revisit and edit what you did before
- Keep the list of things that you've learned
- Sub-skills - some part of the skill e.g. reading could be simpler than say writing in a language
- Spacing - multiple attempts to tackle the problem shows bad results in short-term, but works best for long term. Spacing effect. Night cramming session creates great result next day, but little will be recallable in the long run. New learning depends on prior learning, so we benefit from spacing
- Learning vs Performance: Don't use current performance as measure of learning. Retrieval from short term memory doesn't make recall better, while interleaving forces information to fade away from short term memory and following recall strengthen the long term memory
- Anytime someone gives you an answer instead of figuring it yourself you rob yourself from of a powerful learning opportunity
- Desirable difficulty: Interleaving different types of practice (not blocking), spacing, deep dive into certain topic, testing, Novelty, mixing loads makes us better prepared for the novelty
- Reading, writing or watching have no retrieval phase so no long term memory affect
- We need to spend more time testing ourselves as it has a great result on learning: causes us to reflect what and how much we've actually learned and second it causes all of three: spacing, retrieval, interleaving. Focus rather than on input(=consuming), on output (=summary, retrieval, concluding, thinking)
- Incidental learning - learning while doing it for fun. It maybe more effective - low confidence may prevent people from intentional learning. It maybe more efficient - one can learn it every day during a day routine. It may be more enjoyable - no effort needed to start
- Plateau
- Sampling period
- How Japanese students learn? Research and open ended questions
- There is no tomorrow

- We feel ashamed to start a new things
- Experience based on software engineering
- Weaknesses

	- It's a step towards my dream
	- There is no past and so there is no future
	- Dissociation - become your own shadow, look externally. Ptotege! VS concentrate on effort, fell the body movement. dissociative is worser for max performance, but better if we want to maintain a current pace for longer

## It's hard to become a master

Talking about skill development that takes tens of years to master, the main problem is not to give up. With such a long way to the top, we would face a lot of perfect opportunities to abandon the whole idea. Some skills require hundreds of hours to invest before you can see any results. To make things harder - those results would not be impressive at all. With almost every skill, you spend the most time on a plateau without feeling progress. With other skills, we may give up even before we've tried them because we assume it will be impossible for us to learn them.

How can we become the person that we would like to become?

Essentially there is only one answer - we keep practicing and learning, and after a few thousands of hours, we are done. Unfortunately, there is no other way, and no one has come up with any better idea. On the other hand, people have invented many different methods to help make learning and practicing more effective and overcome short-term difficulties. Using those technics, we could overcome the main issue of giving up, help us in the lowest point, fight through the plateau, recover, and continue the journey. Then eventually, we will reach success.

## Giving up before

People tend to underestimate what can be achieved in the long term. When we make our goals, we attach them to the current state of things; we estimate what we will be able to do in 10 years based on what we can do right now. It's almost impossible even to imagine ourselves becoming a sculptor, directing a movie, or having a crowd singing your song at a concert if we have never done something like that before.

In reality, we could achieve a lot in 10-20 years. With 5 hours a week, you'll get to 5000 hours of practice, which is enough to reach advanced levels in many skills. Talent plays a significant role in becoming top of the field, but getting the top 1% is very much doable with the right dedication and proper practice almost in every skill.

Another problem is that we have the least amount of information before we start. It's the most unclear situation, and there are no ideas about where to begin. The complexity and amount of unknowns could be so overwhelming that we consider acquiring such skills impossible.

## Giving up in the beginning

In the beginning, we may feel the excitement - "It's a beginning of a journey. Soon, I'll become a master!" As we start from zero, almost every minute of practicing improves our skills; we see the progress and the results. It's a beautiful time, but soon you'll start noticing that progress is slowing down. You become aware of all the things you are missing and the things you need to practice and learn. You'll realize how long, challenging, and difficult the journey of becoming a master will be. Surprisingly you'll feel more distant from achieving mastery after you've invested some time in learning than you thought before starting it when you knew nothing. You become aware of the skill's complexity and may think it's impossible to master it.

With some skills, the excitement period may be as short as unboxing time. You may have a dream to make music. Unfortunately, with many musical instruments, you will not make any music for a very long time. In the beginning, practice will contain many exercises and lessons that are hardly similar to your fauvorite song you hope to play one day.

## Giving up because the whole thing is stupid!!!111

Learning is tough. Sometimes it's physically exhausting, and your body reaches its limit, and you can't continue. But much more often, toughness is mental, caused by an infinite flow of errors, mistakes, and failures. It's an essence of learning - we start with something we can't do, and through exercise and practice, we acquire a new skill. We learn from our mistakes. It's a feedback system, a crucial part of long-term improvement. If we are stuck with something for a long time, we can't progress, and things don't work, we may reach the limit and give up on the whole thing.

## Giving up because I will never reach mastery

- "I don't have a talent."
- "It took months, but my friend learned it in 1 hour."
- "I'll never reach the level of this guy."

We constantly compare ourselves with others. To ensure that this is always unfair, we compare one "I" with many others: "This one reached mastery in 5 years; That one is better at A; That is better at B; I'm worse than each of them".

Often, we see others only when they perform, their showcase what they have learned after years of practice, where it looks like they do things effortlessly. We think it's because they have talent, which we do not have. We rarely see their struggle, how they spent thousands of hours exactly like us, frustrated, making mistakes, learning, and slowly progressing.

## Giving up because it's boooooring

            <Title>Comparison</Title>
            <Text>I had lunch with two of my new colleagues, and it turns out both of them are into triathlon. As a runner myself, I became curious about how they train. Turns out neither of them has a training plan and they exercise in a rather chaotic manner, squeezing training into their hectic daily lives with a few hours of training per week. Later on, I realised that both of them are much faster at running than me. Considering that the running stage comes last after hours of swimming and biking, my endurance is also a joke compared to theirs.

Another day, I was reading a book, and the author told a story about how, at 62 years old, he decided to run a half-marathon without any prior experience in running. I love hearing stories like that; they give me hope that when I reach such an age, I will still be able to start new endeavors and live a rich life full of adventures. Then I read that the author achieved a sub-1-hour 10km run after just 2 months of training, something that took me a year to accomplish, and it felt devastating.

Sometimes, we can get motivated when we compare ourselves with others. You see someone performing, and then think, I can do better and practice for hours to prove to yourself that you actually can. Your friend has joined an athletic club and is in great shape now, which inspires you to follow the same path. You may see a marathon race with thousands of participants, some younger than you, others much older, and many slimmer, but not everyone and so your own marathon journey begins.

More often, though, comparisons with others demotivate us. It feels like we don’t have a natural gift for this skill because others are clearly better and also progressing much faster. We start to think that we will never reach such level and begin to doubt whether it’s worth continuing to practice. Things that we’ve accomplished, our progress that we have been proud of, suddenly seem worthless in comparison. Others may have achieved the same things sooner and more easily, and they may not even consider it as a big deal.

Notice how rarely we compare ourselves with those who have a lower skill level. If you are a sculptor, it makes no sense to compare yourself with non-sculptors; it’s pointless. If you’ve been drumming for a year and see a kid having their first lessons, you smile, remembering your own first steps, wish them all the best but don’t even consider comparing yourself, as it’s nonsense. If your goal is to complete a marathon in 4 hours, but your friend’s target is 5 hours, you consider yourselves and your friend to be in different leagues which cannot be compared, as it’s simply not fair.

But we think it’s fair to compare ourselves with those who are better. To make it worser, we compare our singular I to many others - this person is a faster runner than me, another runs longer distances, friend A is a better drummer, and friend B has a bigger house. Regardless of how hard we try, as we compare ourselves to those who are better, the comparison is never in our favour. This holds true whether we’ve just started, are experienced, or have mastered our craft – there is always someone, living or dead, who are better than us.

We actually can’t compare ourselves to others in a fair way. Some may practice twice as many hours as you do, while others may have been doing it for more years. A novice runner may have competed in skiing in the past and will progress with amazing speed. Lucky ones have more free time and money that they can invest into becoming better. Your friend may excel in drumming faster because her mother played the piano, and growing up in such a environment as a child became her inspiration, which may help her when she struggles. Everyone has their own unique journey that cannot be compared in a fair way.

There is only one person who you can compare yourselves with and expect fair comparison - it is you.</Text>

            <Title>Preface</Title>
            <Text>There are many books about mastery, but whenever I read a story about a gifted child who has been passionate about music since they were 5 years old, a part of me dies. When you read interviews with masters, it’s as if they are from a different dimension: doing it their whole life, constantly motivated, always improving, willing to sacrifice everything not related to their craft.

Is there a path to mastery for others? For those without a particular talent, whose motivation is unstable, and who have started things many times but given up just as often?

Saying “either you are motivated to make it or not” makes motivation seem like some sort of magic ability that only a few possess. But where exactly does motivation come from for those who wake up at 5 AM on a Saturday for a long run? And why do some people abandon their fauvorite hobby after years of pure joy?

We don’t lose motivation just because. Things that brought us joy yesterday don’t suddenly become boring today by itself. There are reasons behind those changes, and understanding them can help us keep going.

Reaching mastery takes decades: many years of tough practice, learning, making mistakes, feeling embarrassments and self doubt. This book is about everything that keeps us going, that keeps us from giving up: From the explanation why things happen to the daily practices and strategies that may improve our motivation when we feel down, when we need all the support we can get to fight through.</Text>

            <Title>Replan</Title>
            <Text>It works nicely in movies - you see a hero who is dedicated to winning no matter what: all the obstacles are ignored, all the promises are kept, and even a thunderstorm outside cannot prevent the hero from training. Above everything else, there is a plan that the main hero is following until success is reached.

Ask any software engineer, and they will tell you: The only permanent thing is change. We don’t live in isolation; we are surrounded by our environment. We have families, colleagues, pets, and plants to take care of. The world around us is constantly changing, and every person you know grows and becomes different over the years. We also change, and so do our understandings, beliefs, and desires.

Having a plan and striving to follow it is a way to progress. Bad weather should never be an excuse to skip planned training. But we also have lives. If your child becomes sick and needs you, then following a training plan should not be your concern.

We are also human; watching a movie until late at night can make waking up at 6 AM for a run impossible. Stress from a tough day at work may leave us too tired for an evening practice, and learning a difficult new concept the day before can leave us feeling weak and tired for another session today.

If your plan is strict and solid like a stick, then any external change that requires bending will break it. Missing a training session means promises are broken, and there is a risk that the entire plan will be abandoned. What is the point of continuing if things don’t go according to the plan?

Make the plan fluid, adapt to changes, and replan relentlessly.

Replanning doesn’t mean giving yourself permission to skip practice sessions whenever obstacles appear. We plan to achieve a goal, and the goal should remain the same, but change the way you are going to achieve it. Move things around, reschedule, compromise - find a way to move forward even when circumstances are not in your favour.

If a Saturday long run is not possible, go for a 1-hour run. Yes, it’s not a sufficient substitute, but it’s better than nothing. If you run out of clay, then switch to sketching for the next sculpture; work with what you have. If drumming practice gets canceled, and you have no access to the instrument, go for a run instead. Yes, running is not even related to the music, and yes, it’s sad that drums are not available, and your plan was different, but that’s what you have; work with that.</Text>

When we start learning a new skill, we struggle with everything: in writing, words don’t come out; in running, we can’t keep our breath; in drumming, we fail to use our hands and legs independently. Even though it feels tough, such discomfort and struggle are indicators of learning.

In the beginning, every minute you spend practicing a skill will make you better. The body responds to training by adapting to the stress placed on it; your brain forms new neural connections. When we take our first steps, every learning and practice session is efficient.

As we progress and become better, the same things become easier for us, the struggle fades away, and we feel great in such comforting environments where we can relax and perform what we’ve learned before. This is also the moment when learning stops.

There are many musicians who have played for thousands of hours but remain at a rather average level. There are numerous artists who have been painting for decades but have yet to reach the level of technique that leaves viewers breathless. They stopped progressing because their focus shifted from learning to performing what they’ve already learned.

At the beginning, for runners, the most effective thing you can do is to run - just go out and jog. As you advance in this skill, such training becomes less and less efficient until one day you realize that you hardly progress even though you run for 5 hours a week. As you advance in the skill, the efficiency of your learning and practice sessions will eventually start to drop if you don’t pay attention to it.

To progress, we need to learn, and learning cannot happen when things are easy. Throw yourself into challenges, pick targets from more advanced levels, and strive for the impossible.

Remember the feeling when you took your first steps into a new skill, and keep that struggling feeling close to you forever.</Text>

            <Title>Approaching challenges</Title>
            <Text>When the running race starts, it’s straightforward. You’ve been training and practicing, preparing for this moment, and now it’s time for the performance. It’s a big show where you demonstrate to others and yourself everything that you’ve learned. Races are about execution; you put in all the effort in the hope of proving to yourself what you are capable of. But the challenge starts even before the race starts.

All skills involve challenges: it could be races, auditions, live performances, or attempting to set a personal record in the gym. Difficult training can be challenging in itself; a giant limestone waiting for you to sculpt in your backyard is the one. Challenges can be short, like giving your first public speech, or large-scale, like writing a book. They can be something you need to do because your training plan says so, race day is approaching, or an art competition is starting. Or it can be wild ideas that suddenly occur to you, and now you’re thinking whether you should accept such a challenge.

Accepting the challenge is a challenge on its own. You sit at home, thinking whether you should go out, anticipating the suffering, fatigue, and discomfort that you would need to endure. You’re filled with anxiety, fear of shame and embarrassment, and most importantly, fear of failure. These are the moments when things are so fragile that even a single negative thought or a recalled positive experience could affect the outcome.

If you are sitting at home and trying to motivate yourself for a challenging training session, keep in mind the present-state bias. Regardless of the long-term benefits, we tend to make decisions based on our current physical state and mood. If we feel tired now, we might decline an offer from a friend to participate in a race a week later. If we feel cold now, it’s more likely that we’ll decide not to go for a winter run that evening. If you woke up at 5 AM and feel sleepy, you might decide not to go for the training in a gym today, even though it starts in one hour and you have plenty of time to allow your body to wake up and enjoy a couple of cups of coffee or some sugar if needed.

The Missouri American Water MR340 is the world’s longest ultra paddling race, covering 340 miles (547 km), and it takes up to 4 days to complete. It’s a cruel race that pushes participants to their physical and mental limits. Bryan Hopkins, who has participated in this race five times, offers advice in Ultra Marathon Paddling: Never quit while on the water. He suggests taking a break on the shore and getting some rest before making any decisions. Many athletes have felt miserable while paddling and decided to quit, only to realize half an hour later in the parking lot that they could have continued.

If you’ve just come home feeling tired, then don’t make a decision just yet about your evening drum practice - the fragile balance may not be in your favour right now. Instead, take a nap, hop in the shower, go for a walk, or have a cup of tea with your relatives. Ten minutes of meditation can work wonders. Do anything that helps you recover. If recovery isn’t possible, cheat - a cup of coffee and a piece of candy might be enough to give your brain the illusion of an energy boost. Full recovery is not needed; even a small one could make you feel better, and that’s the point. Now, you can actually decide what you want to do.

Ultra runners never run the entire ultra marathon distance; instead, they split it into multiple parts in their minds and focus on only the current part. When you ask writers how they write, the common answer is word by word. Focus on the next step, which is always easier than the challenge itself. Even if you feel tired, it shouldn’t be a problem to pack clothes, walk to the parking lot, and drive to the gym. Don’t think about what will happen next; focus on what you need to do now. You’ll figure out the next steps once you’re there.

Twyla Tharp describes her morning ritual in The Creative Habit: she wakes up every day at 5:30 AM, takes a cab to the gym, and works out for two hours. The key to her ritual is not the gym itself, but the act of waking up and taking a taxi to the gym. By focusing on just the first steps, it becomes easier to start and reduces the risk of failure. Even if she wakes up feeling tired, it’s still possible to take a taxi to the gym, and she figures out what to do along the way.

Endurance athletes need to spend hours performing near their limit, experiencing mental and physical fatigue and pain. How do they tolerate so many hours of suffering? Top performers focus on their bodies: how they breathe, how they run, and they pay attention to the pain they experience. Their whole mind is dedicated to only one thing - how they are performing right now. They lock themselves in the moment, and in that particular moment, only their body exists. This technique is called internal focus and is considered the best approach if you want to set a personal record.

If you want to maintain a certain pace for as long as possible, then dissociation is the best coping strategy. Rather than focusing on what is happening right now with your body, you dissociate from it and force your mind to focus on something else: solving math problems, singing a song, thinking about past experiences or planning the future, engaging in internal dialogs, repeating mental mantras, or simply counting 1–2–3–4 with every step. My friend, who is a marathon runner, once told me that during races, he listens to only one song, which constantly repeats.

Whenever you are struggling to go out for the tough run or thinking if you should do a challenging practice or not - dissociate yourself from it.

As humans, we are often better at giving advice to others than to ourselves. This is because when advising others, we tend to be more rational, benefiting from emotional detachment and an outside perspective. When giving advice to others, we consider the bigger picture, taking into account long-term consequences and the person’s goals. This is something that can be more challenging to do when we think about ourselves. To overcome this challenge, we can employ a technique called self-distancing - talking about ourselves from a third-person perspective. You can use he/she/they to refer to yourselves or use your name, avoiding the use of you as it’s not as effective.

When you struggle to start writing, cannot begin a difficult learning session, or go out for a hard training, stop and think about it. What if you’ve been a coach - what kind of advice would you give to this struggling person who is tired and needs your support? You are the perfect coach who knows exactly what this person needs right now, so go and tell it:

John, I agree that you are tired, but today is a very important hill training session that will make you better in the mountains. You need it for the race, and it will bring you closer to your dream of finishing it. So, once you're at home, change your clothes, make a cup of coffee, turn on some hardcore metal music - I know you love it - rest for 15 minutes, and then jump in the car to drive to the hills. You've done it before, and I believe you can do it today.

Your coach knows the best and believes in you, so should you.

What is your goal? Why did you start it? Whenever you struggle, remind yourself of your dream - what you want to achieve. Every time you say yes to the challenge, you bring yourself closer to your dream. Every time you say no, you push your dream further away. Yes, it’s hard, and yes, the performance for the challenge you are after may not be pleasant - you’re going to suffer. But you are going to suffer for a purpose and your dream is bigger than any kind of suffering.</Text>

            <Title>Progress</Title>
            <Text>Feeling of progress is the main motivator in skill learning. You become better, unlock things that were not possible before, and see the results of your practice and training. When progress is invisible, it’s hard to continue putting effort into learning.

In some skills, the hardest part is the beginning. With musical instruments, at first, you’ll be making sounds instead of music. Going to the gym in the first few months will result in muscle pain rather than muscle growth. Pursuing art will yield ugliness, rather than beauty.

There might be no clear markers of progress. This is a main reason why newcomers often give up in the beginning—they see no results from their efforts. It’s also why people who have been practicing a skill for many years can hardly understand why newcomers quit. When you’ve reached advanced levels of the skill, it continues to deliver results: you earn medals for race participations, have new sculptures on a shelf, or add learned songs to your repertoire.

There is one metric that keeps progressing, regardless of your skill level or the type of skill you’re practicing: time. Time spent on skill practice is the best indicator for beginners to have a sense of progress. Setting arbitrary goals like spending 5 hours a week in the gym, achieving a total of 50 hours there, or reaching 200 hours of running per year can create a strong sense of progress until the skill itself starts showing it.

Not all time spent is equal, and time spent is not a perfect indicator - optimising this metric might lead to spending a lot of time in the gym doing nothing. It’s not a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that your company needs to optimise. It’s a number that you measure, not one you optimise. It’s a number for yourself alone, not a public figure you share on social networks.

The lack of a feeling of progress can affect not only newcomers. In fact, when you’ve reached more advanced levels, most of the time is spent on a plateau. This can be even more frustrating than for newcomers, as you put more effort into pushing your limits, yet mastery might seem farther away than you can achieve. One way to break through such plateaus is patience, time, and deliberate practice.

Deliberate practice involves focusing on your weakest points and working towards improving them.</Text>

            <Title>Difficulty</Title>
            <Text>Training plans for runners consist of microcycles. You start with low intensity and smaller volumes, then the following week is slightly harder, and in the third week, you have to do a lot of high-intensity training with high volumes. The week after is for recovery, where intensity is very low, and volumes are smaller. Such cycles allow your body to adapt to the stress and slowly build up fitness. They also allow you to mix easy and difficult training sessions.

Training when you are close to your physical limits; musical practice when you are completely focused, trying to play the hardest part of the song perfectly; sculpting sessions when you work on hands, striving to get the right impression of the sculpture’s palm and its fingers – those are the moments of the greatest effort.

It’s tempting to do that every time - always challenge yourself and work as hard as you can, focusing on the most difficult parts. Such bursts are very effective and have the greatest impact on your skill development, but they are impossible to maintain for a long time.

There is a physical aspect to it: the stress of training may improve our capabilities, but only with sufficient recovery. Our bodies need time to adapt, and they do so when there is enough rest. That’s why you see microcycles across all kinds of sports.

There is also a mental aspect to mixing difficulties. Running short intervals where muscles and lungs are burning, when we gasp desperately trying to get more oxygen - those are moments of great suffering. If every training session is like that, then it’s only a matter of time before you start skipping them.

When you are at home, drinking tea while sitting on your favourite couch, it takes a lot of effort to stand up and go for a run. This is a moment when anticipation plays a significant role: You imagine the discomfort, wet socks after stepping in a puddle, the pain in your calves, and the hills that leave you gasping for breath.

When we know that music practice is going to push us close to our limits and consist of a constant flow of mistakes while striving for the perfect play, our brain starts to become very creative in finding excuses for skipping the practice — I don't feel well. I had a tough day at work. I'll skip, but catch up on Sunday. It requires a great amount of mental energy to leave the comfort of your home and go for practice, knowing that it will not be comforting and fun, but rather an intimidating and challenging session that will demand all possible effort and total focus.

Make some training or lessons easy (relative to your skill level) - practice songs that you’ve already mastered before, learn new ones which are the joke for your current level. Have fun with these sessions, introduce new elements, improvise, and change them in a way that feels enjoyable to you. When sculpting, create a smaller-scale piece that you can finish in one hour, create small Pokemon for your kids or clay copy of the fork just for fun.

Avoid situations when you start associating practise with challenge. You need hard sessions to progress and making every lesson easy is not a solution either - you’ll grow bored soon and abandon training completely. By mixing learning of different difficulty aim to create an impression that on average practise sessions requires effort, but you can sustain it every time.

You can mix difficulty even within one session. With drums you can start by playing along your favourite songs just for fun, then switch to the lesson and do the hardest part. In the end when you are exhausted do a few easy exercises or songs.

When we see ourselves doing things with ease it reminds us how far we’ve went with the skill development. Learning is a constant struggle where we strive for better, but easy sessions reminds us of the things we’ve learned and mastered. Easy sessions is about reminding us how good we are.</Text>

            <Title>Starting</Title>
            <Text>When you start a new endeavour, like learning to play the piano, you are only truly learning when you practice. It’s only when you run that you become better at it. It’s only when you sculpt that you become a sculptor.

Listening to how other people play, watching others explain how to sculpt, or reading articles on getting started with running has no effect on your skill. You only make progress when you practice. All tutorials, lectures, books, and learning videos have no direct effect on your skill until you start applying them and practicing. Watching getting-started videos on YouTube creates an illusion that we are learning and becoming better, while in reality, we are lying down on a coach for an hour, not moving.

It’s entertaining to watch other people’s stories; it’s safe because you cannot make a mistake while others are doing it, and it’s easy to drink tea while sitting on a couch and watching other people suffer while climbing a mountain. Don’t fall into the trap of infinite preparation. I need to know what to expect is an excuse to delay a discomforting and scary moment when you need to step out of your comfort home and get your shoes dirty on your first run.

Some minimum preparation is always needed – by all means, check how to do a proper deadlift before you hit the gym. Watch one or two videos, get to know the exercises for the proper technique, but keep in mind that you cannot learn it while lying down on the sofa. It’s a waste of time to keep watching big guys on YouTube, waiting for full understanding – it will never come, as understanding comes from practice. It’s a waste of time to wait until you feel confident, as confidence comes only from doing.

Don’t get paralysed by the choice. Searching for best violin for beginners will yield millions of pages, and it’s tempting to search for best page with the best violins for beginners to find the best rank first. Choose whatever, or even better, visit your local music store, ask for beginner options, get one that they have in stock and have your first practice session already this evening.

When you begin with new skills, the focus should be on starting to do it. Reading or watching videos doesn’t count; finding a perfect course is a waste of time – any would do. Go for a run with whatever shoes and clothes you use for work; for sculpting, take plasticine from your kids or mud from the street. Instead of searching for a gym, start doing pushups and ab crunches in your living room.

When we start learning a new skill, any kind of choice will be wrong and, at the same time, irrelevant. Which is better, electronic drums or acoustic? Is a course about colour theory any good? Should I get oil clay, polymer one, or a water-based? At the beginning, we are least qualified to make a choice.

Anything you choose is wrong because, in the beginning, we don’t know what we actually want. I want to run is too abstract to choose the right pair of shoes - one for sprinting is different from one for marathon on a trail. I want to play drums is too vague, as a drum kit for metal differs from one for jazz. You need to make a choice now, but you will understand what you actually prefer long after.

At the same time, anything you choose is irrelevant, as you will not feel the difference between a metal or jazz drum set just yet. The quality of your sculptures will not be affected by what type of clay you choose or what kind of paints or brushes you select for your painting.

When you start learning a new skill, choose whatever can get you to practice as soon as possible. Select the course that begins tomorrow, pick shoes that the shop near you has in stock. Focus on practice, learn the nuances of your craft, and then you will be able to understand which choices are essential and how to make the right ones.

Don’t become better at preparation for running, but become better in running itself.</Text>

            <Title>Recovery</Title>
            <Text>Many know how to rest, but few know how to recover. To keep moving and getting better day after day, year after year we have to learn how to recover.

Rest means not doing an activity, while recovery means doing something that help us get energy back and be ready to practice again. Lying on a sofa is a rest, but it’s not really recovering. Actually, just lying on a sofa can be a way to recover, and it’s actually quite difficult to do – just lying there without holding a phone or watching TV.

Many times, when we feel tired, we turn to things that entertain us: games, Netflix or watching cats on YouTube. Watching cats can be relaxing and definitely entertaining, but it doesn’t help us to recover and doesn’t restore our mental energy levels. Almost any kind of consumption requires cognitive effort and doesn’t give our brain a proper break.

Some skills require physical recovery, but all skills require the restoration of mental energy. We skip training not because we physically cannot get to the gym, but because we cannot convince ourselves to go there. When our mental capacity is exhausted, we feel like we’ve lost motivation and interest in doing things – all because we’ve failed to give our brain a chance to recover.

In our modern world, filled with many distractions, we need to consciously make an effort to give our brains a break from constant stimulation.

Sleep is the most effective way to recover, and a full night of sleep have the greatest impact on energy levels. When you read about masters or scholars who have gone through intense learning, you may find that daily naps mentioned frequently.

Activities like meditation, taking a walk outside, reading a book, taking shower or even simply sitting quietly can provide an effective recovery. Being lost in doing music or art can provide an effective way to recover as well.

When feeling tired don’t rest - recover.</Text>

            <Title>Perfect week</Title>
            <Text>It’s Sunday evening, and I’m sitting on a couch, thinking about the upcoming week - what I plan to achieve and how much time I need to spend on practicing different skills. I have an idea about a certain amount of hours that have to be spent every week to progress, and I aim for that number every week.

We all have those numbers - how many times we should visit the gym, the minimum number of pages we need to write to meet a deadline, or the number of exercises that should be practiced with a musical instrument. Targets should exist so we can align our lives with them, but failing to meet them should never be considered a failure.

If your plan was to hit the gym three times a week, but you only managed to go once, it’s tempting to say that you’ve failed. When you visit the gym only twice the following week, you may start to experience the first signs of doubt: I have no willpower to keep my own promise, maybe I'm not capable of it at all. After a few more weeks, giving up on the whole idea becomes an option.

When you set a goal for the week, you often plan it as if everything will be perfect. You schedule specific days and times, envision how long each exercise will take, and determine how many you’ll do. You’ll also assume that nothing in your surroundings will change and that nothing will interfere with your goals.

We don’t live in isolation; life happens, and it can negatively impact our goals. You might become injured, find that your gym is closed, car have a flat tire, have a night with no sleep, or encounter any other nasty surprises that life is rich with. Unfortunately, it’s not always balanced, and compensation rarely comes. I’m still waiting for that unexpected day off when I’ll be able to squeeze in an extra training session.

When you set a goal for the week, make it explicit: what would be a perfect week? Then, strive to achieve that by doing everything you can - reschedule missing practice sessions, compromise, rearrange your schedule or wake up at 5 AM if needed.

At the end of the week, see how close you are to reaching your goal. Did you achieve it? That’s awesome - you’ve reached perfection. If you reached only 80% of it, that’s a great result as perfection is hardly achievable and life can interfere, so it’s perfectly fine. Made it only to 10%? 10% of perfection sounds not that bad, next week there would be another attempt.

Reaching a perfect goal shouldn’t be easy. If you’re achieving it every week, your aim may be set too low. However, it should be attainable with hard effort. Start with an educated guess and see if you can reach it. Don’t hesitate to adjust it as you go along. We grow, our lives and environments change constantly, and so does our image of a perfect goal.</Text>

            <Title>Consumption</Title>
            <Text>If you decide to watch all getting started for runners videos, you’ll die before you go for a first run. You can find an answer on any question you have and this is what we, as a humanity, have gifted to ourselves. You can explore new skills, get inspired, find instructions, training plans or race reports. Lack of information is not a problem anymore - we can find information about any skill and start learning it from any point in the world.

We can watch races and competitions, see interviews with masters and sometimes get so close to them and observe how they work and live in real time.

Watching others may inspire us, we can learn from it and we can become better at doing. But sometimes watching others makes us do less. You may have a need, a desire to satisfy: willingness to move, to go for a run, idea of a new project or emotion that you want to express yourself in art. Watch a video how others do that and your brain will be satisfied, the need will become less strong or disappear completely. Watching how others do sports decreases a willingness to do it yourself.

Watch an adventure movie, all the emotions: desire to explore the unknowns, curiosity, novelty, fear and excitement, satisfaction in the end, will be real, but actually you’ve been laying down on a sofa without moving for 2 hours.

Watching how others are doing things makes us compare. You watch how people running in a desert, on top on volcano or in Amazon jungles and then having a run in the forest close to you become boring. You want to make a sculpture, to express yourselves, to capture your emotions in clay, but after watching few videos of other better sculptors, you see clearly that you are not as good as them and motivation is shuttered.

Watching others doing things may have a negative impact on feeling our identities. Writing a book makes you feel more as a writer; feeling more as a writer makes you write more. But when we watch interviews with top writers about their new released book we may feel doubt about ourselves - maybe I am not a writer? ## Failures

Failures are the main reason why we give up. It could be just in the beginning where we start learning new skill with high expectations only to be crushed by the it’s difficulty. Or when you become good at it, after years of practice, realising that it’s impossible to be as good as masters.

Failures is like a cruel teacher that punishes you when you make mistake and fills us with doubt about our ability to continue. It might seem like a curse to have a teacher like that, but despite its archaic methods, its goal is to teach you.

Failures are just pointers to our weakest points: To some part of our skill that needs correction or enhancement. To the part or our skill that limits us, something which, when improved, will allow us to reach a new level and unlock capabilities that wasn’t possible before.

To learn the lesson, there is one thing we need to do: to reflect on it. What exactly had happened and what mistakes did we make? What exactly is the weakest point that surfaced and caused the failure? Write it all down, think about your failure and by doing it you’ll grow.

We make mistakes and recover in every skill all the time. In writing, it’s more explicit than ever: the very first sentence we write is always ugly, and sometimes it’s physically painful to observe how poorly we’ve expressed a thought on paper. It’s surprising that we have ever written anything before; it’s obvious that even a 2-year-old can express their thoughts in a clearer way. We delete the sentence and rewrite it, only to end up with a slightly better version of it. It’s still embarrassing, but we keep going - deleting and rewriting, editing and making it clearer - until it becomes okay. By all literature standards, it’s still bad, but something good starting to appear. The first version, which was nothing but a failure, transforms into something valuable and worthy.

Failures also come in the form of broken plans. They could arise from mistakes due to our lack of skill, but mistakes could also be hidden within the plan itself.

Everyone who starts an ultra-running race has a plan. These races could last up to 40 hours, presenting numerous opportunities for things to go wrong, not in accordance with the plan. Realising that you are 3 hours behind your intended schedule will crush your motivation and likely make you to give up. A common strategy is to have three plans.

The first plan assumes perfect execution—when you are performing at your best, pushing the boundaries of your capabilities, and achieving a new personal best. Since our brains tend to overestimate, the very first plan that comes to mind is usually this ideal one. When we imagine the outcomes of a new project or challenge, we often assume perfect execution. Don’t fight against this; instead, accept it and make it explicit that this plan is for when luck is on your side and everything goes perfectly.

The second plan accepts imperfections. There will be unpleasant surprises, unexpected turns, things will be harder that what you’ve expected, and moments when your performance falls short of your previous best.

Third plan is when you left you luck at home. It’s for situations when the weather is at its worst, the terrain is terrible, and your body refuses to cooperate. Generally, third plan is simply about crossing a finish line.

Having three plans addresses the issue of a wrong expectations and overestimation. This approach keeps your goals more aligned with reality. When you fail to achieve your objectives according to the first plan, it doesn’t mean total failure; you’ve just failed of executing it perfectly. You can then shift to the second plan and keep going. Often, things will align with the second plan. However, there are times when misfortune persists and mistakes continue to happen. This is when the third plan comes into play—when conditions are terrible, yet you persist in reaching the finish line no matter what.</Text>

            <Title>Expectations</Title>
            <Text>There is an adrenaline rush when you first go through the doors of the gym or a painting studio. The excitement before leaving home for your first run, or that majestic feeling when you unbox your first guitar. The very first drum set I received was for Christmas, and I spent the whole night assembling it. When I was finished at 2 AM, even though I was afraid of waking up my wife and kids, I couldn’t resist making a gentle hit. I heard a sound, and it felt magical.

Then you get back to reality. On my very first run, I collapsed after 1.7 km and had to take the walk of shame back home. With the guitar, I forgot about its existence after a couple of hours of practice. With some skills, the excitement period may be as short as the unboxing time. You may dream of making music, but with many musical instruments, you will not make any for a very long time - you will be making sounds.

Those are the moments when our expectations are crushed - our views of different skills are based on watching masters performing at their best: those beautiful videos of people running across the Mont Blanc mountain, musicians performing in Carnegie Hall, or seeing magnificent sculptures in Florence. It was our source of inspiration and the reason why we started, but what we’ve got instead is an experience that looks nothing like that.

Ultra running will mostly involve walking. You won’t be able to play drums fast enough for metal; instead, you’ll have to start with common and slower pop music beats. Your first sculptures will be manifestations of ugliness rather than beauty and perfection. Your writing will be sloppy, and you’ll wonder how you actually survived when you clearly aren’t capable of expressing what you think.

It’s not enough to say that everyone struggles. There is a difference when your friend complains that he cannot complete a sub-3-hour marathon run, when you’ve never been able to run for longer than 15 minutes. It’s different when an experienced sculptor fails to capture all the details to make a bust resemble a real person, and when you constantly fail to create a sculpture that looks like a man and keep getting monsters from zombie movies instead.

Or is there any difference?

Who is an ultra runner? It’s an endurance athlete who goes for great distances, pushing mental and physical limits, enduring suffering and pain to the point where it seems impossible to tolerate but keeps going anyway.

If your running limit is 10 minutes, then go for 1 hour and don’t give up, no matter what, until you reach the finish line. Run, walk, fall down, crawl, but keep getting up. During this hour, you’ll be no different from the ultra runners - reaching your own limit where you cannot move but keep going anyway. Ultra running is not about the distances; it’s about being an ultra runner.

Who is a drummer? It’s someone who practices relentlessly to improve their technique, control, and speed, constantly working to enhance their playing. In those moments when you are practicing simple beats, when you hear the metronome ticking away, when you close your eyes to better hear the nuances of the simple sounds you create, when you get lost in the melody you are playing – that’s when you are the drummer. Drumming is not just about speed or complex songs; it’s about being a drummer.

You come for the dream not because you want to run a certain distance or play one particular song and then say you’re done. You come for the dream to become someone - a runner, a sculptor, a drummer, or a writer. You come for the dream to become a master.</Text>

            <Title>Getting back</Title>
            <Text>Before my first ultramarathon, I thought the main thing was to keep running and reach the finish line as fast as I could. It turns out that on longer distances and complex terrains, it’s impossible to run all the time. People switch to walking, and some spend most of their time slowly but steadily moving toward the finish line.

On my first 100km race, I was able to run for only 5 hours, followed by another 19 hours of slow walking until I reached the finish line. That day, I became convinced that the key is to keep walking - as long as I keep moving, I can reach the finish line.

It took a year and another unfinished, given-up race to realize what the key thing actually is. It’s not about how fast we go, whether running or walking. It’s not even about constantly moving forward because there will come a time when we stop, exhausted and unable to move. The main thing is to get back on track and continue.

It doesn’t matter that much how fast you are progressing with the skill you are trying to master. It’s such a long journey that another year means little. If you decide to master quantum physics and contribute to humanity’s knowledge about it, then it hardly matters if it takes 20 or 25 years — what matters is that you will do it one day.

It’s unfortunate, but expected if you stop in the middle. Ask anyone with a Ph.D. about their lowest point, and you will hear stories of desperation in moments when hope was lost. Well-known books were in the garbage bin when disappointed writers thought there was no point in continuing.

It’s not the moment when we stop that we give up, but we give up by not getting back afterwards. All the abandoned places and dreams were not created in the moment when people left them; they continue to exist because people didn’t come back.

It’s not important that you stopped playing the piano ten years ago; what matters is your decision to start doing it again.</Text>

            <Title>Feeling Of Control</Title>
            <Text>I was doing a 70 km solo run in October in Finland. It was a cold autumn day, and all the trails were covered with water. For most of the distance, I was walking knee-deep in the cold water. I slipped on a fallen log while trying to cross a running stream, fell down, and went fully under the freezing water. During the day, I was fine, but when night came, I broke down.

I was wearing 4 layers of clothing, and yet I was shaking from the cold. In the middle of the dark forest, I found a wooden toilet, went inside to hide from the rain, sat down, and gave my legs a break. I couldn’t handle it anymore, but my watch was telling me that I needed to walk another 3 hours. I started to curse and cry at the same time, hating running, the rain, the forest, the cold, and myself.

In those moments, I wasn’t in charge; I was helpless and ready to give up. It felt like I had lost control.

If you are on a diet and every day see that your weight is going down, you feel like you are in charge here and control it. If you wake up every morning to work on a book and see the number of pages slowly increasing, you are the main driver here. Everything is up to you, and you keep going and even failures cannot stop you.

The feeling of control makes us more persistent and helps us when we face obstacles or feel crushed after a failure. It’s a belief in ourselves, a source of self-esteem, which is the main motivational force that supports us when we feel down or even before when we are thinking whether to accept a new challenge.

Just as having a feeling of control moves you forward, not having it will bring you down. If you believe in talent and think that people around you have a natural gift you don’t possess, you will believe that your control is very limited. It become pointless to push hard, and every failure will be perceived as a sign that you are not meant for it.

The feeling of control is self-reinforcing. If you believe you are fully in charge of your progress, facing a failure will make you to adapt, find another way, or practice to eliminate the weakest point in your skill. Solving an issue will make your feeling of control stronger, making you even more resistant to failures. Unfortunately, it works both ways: losing control makes it harder to keep pushing and recover after failures. A harder recovery after failures further diminishes your feeling of control, creating a downward spiral that makes people to give up on mastery completely.

Mastery is all about having high expectations, whether it’s becoming a master itself or achieving the results you expect from training or competitions. High expectations and a lack of control are perfect conditions for stress. You won’t progress far in mastering if you’re constantly under stress. If you have no feeling of control in what you do, it’s inevitable that you will give up.

The feeling of control is affected by many factors. Skipping a training session can make you feel like you are starting to lose control. Making progress every month can make you feel fully in charge. Failing to accomplish a goal will make you feel like you’re doing something wrong and not in control. Seeing your friend achieve what you’ve been dreaming of can fill you with doubt that you are doing things right.

When I started writing this chapter, I spent 2 hours writing and ended up with only the first two sentences. I have no control over how productive my writing will be, but I still feel the control because I woke up at 6 AM, came to the library, and spent 2 hours writing without distraction. Control is about feeling it, not the actual control on the result, which we rarely have a direct impact on.

We don’t have control over the outcomes - how the race will go, whether a sculpture will evoke the intended feeling, whether your live performance will be perfect, or whether the book you are writing will be loved. There is no actual control over outcomes, but it’s about changing your perspective to create a feeling of it.

You do control the training and can exercise uphill running to prepare yourself for the mountains in the race. You can learn about existing sculptures and analyse how famous sculptors use posture and hands to evoke a certain feeling in the viewer. We don’t control the outcomes, but we are in charge of the process - we control how we practice and how we learn.

It’s easy to notice the loss of control when it happens suddenly - you receive an email in which the publisher changes its mind and decides not to publish your book; you’re asked to leave the musical band you’ve been playing with for years, or you realize you’re lost in the wilderness during your run and have no idea where to go. Just a minute ago, you had full control, everything was going fine, and suddenly you lost it.

It’s much harder to notice when control slowly fades away - you feel tired and skip training; you break your diet and eat a candy; you couldn’t wake up and miss a writing session. No one is perfect, and one slip doesn’t mean much. But then, the next week, something else happens, and you skip two training sessions, eat a whole cake, and replace writing with Netflix. You tell yourself that you’re tired, it’s just the consequences, bad luck - our brains are creative in finding excuses. Then, month later, you wake up and realize you’ve lost control and are no longer in charge.

Losing control demotivates us and negatively affects our progress, but it cannot be avoided and happens to everyone. In fact, from time to time, we should seek ways to lose it.

You may have full control practicing public speaking in front of the mirror at home, but stepping onto a stage will make you lose that feeling. The first time you attempt an ultra run in the mountains and see climbs that reach higher than the clouds will crush your confidence and make you scared. You may feel that your book turned out great, but sending the draft to the publisher will suddenly make you feel vulnerable.

Those who take action, learn, and grow are meant to lose the feeling of control now and then. Losing control is not a sign of failure and will happen from time to time - only those who do nothing never experience it. Having control all the time should never be your goal. Reading about running, watching videos about sculpting is safe, but it gives us an illusion of control.

Let the loss of control happen from time to time - allow yourself to jump into the void.

Don’t be afraid of it; no one has avoided it. Accept it; it’s as natural as breathing. Losing control is a sign of attempting to do what you haven’t done before. Remember that you’ve lost the feeling of control; the actual control of the outcome was never there. It’s about feeling that you need to restore. It’s a pure mental exercise over which you have full control.

Have you ever wondered why athletes perform rituals before a competition begins? Some listen to a particular song, others repeat their stretching routine, many wear their lucky items, repeat mantras, or check their equipment in a very strict order. These rituals provide a sense of control in situations where they have no control whatsoever. Focus on those tiny, controllable things and slowly regain that feeling.

Some time ago, I missed my morning writing routine. The same happened the next day, and there was another reason on day 3. A month later, I realised I hadn’t done any writing for a month and had lost all control over it; it had slowly disappeared in the chores of everyday life. To recover, I focused on what I could control - going to bed on time, waking up early in the morning, brewing a thermos of coffee, and spending the morning in the nearby library. Writing followed, and control was regained.

The feeling of control is relative. You might feel fully in charge with just one swim training per week, but feeling lost it if there are fewer than 5 running training sessions in the same time. It all depends on your reference point - what you’re comparing yourself to. If in the first month of writing a book, you wrote 50 pages, and in the next month, you managed only 30, it can make you feel like you’re losing control over your writing. This feeling of losing control can lead to writing only 10 pages in the following month and, eventually, abandoning the whole writing project.

Remember the most important reference point - zero.

Whether it was 30 pages or just 1 page you wrote in a month, 1 running training squeezed into a hectic week, or a few drumming sessions you managed to find time for, these are all the results of your planning and execution. These are the things you controlled. You shaped your life according to your will and achieved all of these. Next month bend your life a bit harder - you control it and can change in way you like it to be.

You may feel fully in charge of your running, but feeling no control when it comes to your diet. It’s relevant to the skill you are mastering. But control, as a feeling, intertwines in a complex way with everything that surrounds you, which can be both a bad and a good thing.

At the beginning of the year, I got fired, and it crushed my ego. Being a professional is a significant part of my self-identity, and such a failure filled me with a lot of doubt about who I am. Watching my savings fading away in my bank account destroyed my feeling of security and confidence, and I realised that I had lost all control in life. Although the failure happened in my professional life and should have no impact on other activities, it did. I couldn’t run or, to be honest, do anything. Losing control in one field, especially a crushing one like an injury, a bad project outcome, or the crushing of hopes, can have a negative impact on other areas.

The good thing is that it works the other way as well. To get my life together, I decided to follow a diet and eliminate sugar. After a successful week, I began to feel good about myself - I cat resist temptation and control what I eat. Then, I established a sleep schedule, aiming to wake up every day at 6 AM. Once that was in place, I had a sense that control was returning, and I could structure my life the way I wanted. Running and other activities came back, further reinforcing the feeling of control, and normal life resumed.</Text>

            <Title>Lack of time</Title>
            <Text>I’m in the cafe. In front of me, there is an old gentleman reading a newspaper; he doesn’t seem to be in a hurry. Besides me, there are a bunch of young girls laughing loudly and enjoying their time together - they also don’t seem worried about the passing time. I’m sitting here, writing these lines, simultaneously stressed about the lack of time and anxious that the time I was given is going to waste.

I desperately need more time - for writing, for music, for running, and for all other endeavors that I haven’t even had time to start. I’m way behind schedule in my training, in music, and haven’t held clay in my hands for a few months.

Lack of time is something from which we all suffer. We wish for it to disappear so that we would have enough time for everything, enough time to realize every single wish we have. If only we could have more time, then we could complete everything.

I hope this never happens to you.

On those days when you wake up at 6 in the morning to squeeze in a run, followed by breakfast with the kids, rushing to drive them to school, going to the office to solve urgent work issues, catching up with past colleagues about their lives during a quick lunch, going back home to spend time with your family, and being able to read just a few pages before falling asleep, such a lack of time is not a curse but a gift.

Lack of time is a sign that we have so many opportunities lying in front of us that we have to choose which ones to pursue. Being healthy presents dozens of opportunities across many kinds of sports. Being educated and knowledgeable opens up thousands of new skills that we can learn. Being intelligent allows us to see the problems that surround us and solve them. Lack of time is a sign that we have a choice, that we have so many doors open for us.

It’s not a lack of time that needs to be solved, but the problem that sometimes we choose the wrong door. Every minute that we live, we make a choice on how to spend that minute. It’s not about making every minute count; it’s about realising that you are the one who is making that choice. Every. Single. Minute.</Text>

            <Title>Environment</Title>
            <Text>The environment defines our mood. If you’ve just woken up, lying in your bed and thinking you’re not in the mood for the gym, remember that a warm bed environment is primarily for rest, and your mood would align with that.

To get in the mood for working out, you need to change your environment first. Once you’re in the right place, you’ll start feeling energised and ready for a high-intensity training. Don’t expect to be in the mood until you’re in the right environment: first switch it, and the mood will follow.

Keep in mind the environment you’re in and be mindful of the mood it creates. If you primarily use your computer for games, don’t be surprised when, with the intention of learning programming, you turn it on but end up playing instead. If you use your room mainly for rest and entertainment, it will be challenging to learn there. Take a moment to look around and ask yourself: Does this environment create the mood I need? If not - switch.

Be careful with the environment and avoid spoiling it. If you use the library for learning, then avoid watching Netflix there. If you have a working computer, don’t play games on it. The gym should remain solely for working out. When the environment becomes spoiled with other things, the mood switching disappears. You may come to the library and not feel in the mood for learning anymore.

When it happens - switch. Sometimes, choosing a different table may work, and sometimes switching to another library or gym may be needed. Don’t be hard on yourself when it happens - in my home, there isn’t a single corner that I haven’t spoiled yet. Accept it and look for a new place; you’ll greatly benefit from the switch. Sometimes, you just need a break, and after a while, a spoiled environment will become effective again.

The environment defines which ideas come to our minds. Ideas don’t appear randomly in our heads by themselves, but originate from our surroundings – from what we do and have done, from our friends or colleagues, from what we see happening around us, and from things we consume, like books or movies. Ideas are the product of our environments, constrained by our capabilities, and mixed with the ideas that surround us.

What kind of ideas are flowing in your environment, and what ideas cannot appear there? You may sit in a library and see students surrounding you, one learning mechanical engineering, another studying gene modification, and another reading a quantum physics book. Later that evening, you may become curious and dive into one of those topics, but the idea of running 100 miles in the mountains will unlikely to appear there.

If you’re swimming in the pool and see a girl with an Iron Man cap, it may define what you’re going to do next year, but the chances are rather low that you’ll get the idea of creating a mobile game and dive into game development while being there.

If your environment is primarily focused on watching Netflix and playing computer games, then the ideas that come to your head will likely revolve around new series and games to play. Perhaps, you might start to wonder what it takes to direct a movie or what makes games fun to play, potentially leading you to explore game design.

If you want to reduce the number of ideas of a certain kind, then switch from the environment that creates those ideas. Go outside to reduce watching Netflix, and to avoid infinite Internet consumption, leave your phone in another room. If you want to have more ideas of a certain type, then switch the environment first, and the ideas will follow. Visit the craft store, even if you don’t know what to craft. Go to the DIY hardware shop, and the idea of building a treehouse, crafting custom garden furniture, or embarking on a home renovation project will appear by itself.

Switch the environment first, and ideas will follow. Don’t expect to get ideas of one kind in an environment where they are unlikely to appear.

We are surrounded by the environment, but we have the power to expand it and collapse it. Watching the news can suddenly make your neighbourhood expand to include the entire world, and a disaster on the other side of the planet becomes closer. You may have no writer friends, but finding an online writer’s club can make you feel like you are a part of this group.

You can include a nearby gym and a running track as part of your environment if you start going there often. A coffee house close to you could become your place if you spend every Sunday writing or reading there. The forest and the night stars will become yours if you start hiking and spending nights there.

We are lucky to live in a world where accessing information is hardly a problem. You may have seen a map in a fantasy book and wondered how it was drawn, and the next moment, you discover the wonderful world of cartography, maps, and fantasy world-building. With libraries, you can get access to millions of books, and with the Internet, you can find information about anything, expanding your environment to include new, exciting, and unexplored area.

We can expand our environment by our will, but we can also collapse it if we wish. If your friend is going deeper and deeper into bad behavior that negatively affects you, you can limit or cut your connection to reduce the exposure. If you have a problem with social networks or computer games, you can delete an account or throw away the phone. It’s not necessary the best solution, but we have the power to use it if we wish.</Text>

            <Title>Treats</Title>
            <Text>Ultra running is physically tough, but the main battle is mental - you need to keep going no matter how bad you feel. Anything that can ease the mental pressure is worth using. One such thing is to carry a treat - something that you enjoy eating - and use it at the right moment. It may sound like a small and unimportant detail, but sometimes even the slightest support is what we need to be able to continue.

Treat yourself - buy the signature drumsticks of your favourite drummer, get a new running cap because it looks beautiful, or find a 100-year-old typewriter to place on a table where you write. These things are not going to affect your skill level in any way, but they will support your new identity and make you feel better.

Buying new things should never become your goal, and by all means, avoid setting a prize for your effort. If I run 100km in a week, then I'll buy myself new sneakers may sound like a good motivation boost, but in reality, it will crush your desire for running. If we love running, then how can an additional prize on top can demotivate us?

When you go for a run, you do it because it makes you feel good and happy. When there is a prize at the end, your focus shifts to earning it, and you start running for that prize. Rarely does a pair of new sneakers motivate us more than the feeling of happiness and joy.

You may be sitting and enjoying solving a puzzle, and someone offers you a dollar to solve it, and suddenly the fun is gone. Don’t take the fun away from yourself. Go and buy an ice cream after the training because you want to treat yourself, but never do the training for the ice cream. And don’t overuse it - it’s not a treat anymore if you use it every day.</Text>

            <Title>Boredom</Title>
            <Text>It’s rather common to hear that your friends abandoned their hobbies because they got bored with that, and likely you’ve also given up on a few beginnings for the same reason. Why does this happen? Why we could enjoy something for years and one day realise that it’s not fun anymore? 

Things we can do - we don't want to do.
Things we want to do - we can't do.

When we feel bored, quite often the underlying reason is that we’ve stopped progressing and stuck on the same skill level, repeating the same things over and over again. Remember yourself in the beginning of the journey, when you were excited about every training and practice session, what was it? Why it wasn’t boring before?

Was it a feeling of a progress - feeling of an accomplishment every time you practice your craft? Was it sense of novelty and discovery where everything was new and exciting? Or was it so that you’ve simply loved the process of doing it without too much thinking about the end result - dive in and flow?

Boredom happens because of two conflicting issues - fear of challenges and fixating on end result progress.

When you’ve been practicing your skill for a few years, you reach a certain good level with that. You are far from being a master, but can’t associate yourself with a novice anymore. You have experience, you have wisdom, you’ve went through hundreds and maybe thousands of hours of practice and feel that you are probably better than an average. That is the moment when, deep below, fear is born. Fear of being a novice again.

Every skill has a variety of details and sub-skills that you can master. With drums you can master speed to play heavy metal or you can become better in Jazz like improvisations. Both are about drums, but hardly have any similarities and mastering one have little affect on another. You can spend years working on a speed and being good at it, but learning improvisations would be like a starting from a scratch - it will make you feel like you are a novice again. You’ll get back to the level where 10 years kids, who have been going to the Jazz drum school, will be better than you. It’s fine if you’re the beginner, but getting back to this level after few years of practice is not something everyone can comprehend.

Remember yourself in the beginning - you didn’t afraid of a new challenges, you didn’t afraid of looking stupid or embarrassed, making silly mistakes or trying things you have never tried before. Embrace being a novice again - we’ve all been kids before trying new things without fear of a failure. Try new things, accept new challenges where you’re terrible at, fail miserably, be proud that you’ve tried and start over.

I remember myself when I’ve discovered love for running few years ago. I’ve talked with my, much more experienced, runner friend and he asked me if I have a training program. I said no and explained that I’m running every day. My friend suggested that it’s probably not the most optimal strategy to which I’ve replied with “Nah, it’s fine. I love running a lot”.

Yesterday training were on a treadmill which was all about incline level, my pace, my heart rate. I was constantly checking my cadence, my running form, my hands and how much liquid I’ve consumed. I’ve enjoyed the training and bet it was rather effective for my fitness level. But I wasn’t as happy as I was years ago when I was running with no watch, no running form, no goals when only thing I was carrying was a love for running. 

As we progress with any skill we tend to become fixated on a progress, on our goals, on our results, completely forgetting why we’ve started doing it all - because we love doing it. We’ve started it because we loved the process itself, we’ve enjoyed the doing part and accomplishment were a nice bonus. Kids draw not because they want to become better at it, but because they love doing so. 

Forget your goals now and then - embrace the love for your craft that you still carry and do things because you love doing it, not because it’s a way to accomplish something. Put away your watch, your course exercises, training programs and simply do what you love.

            <Title>What comes after dream?</Title>
            <Text>A dream is a vague idea, often lacking a clear first step and a concrete final destination. It’s like a blurry vision where you see yourself in a spacesuit working on the Moon or sitting in a chair in your studio, writing a book. Dreams are expected to be unclear and idealistic views of the new you.
I want to become a sculptor is a dream. It’s fine that there is no clear way to start, and it’s also okay that there is no concrete destination. Am I already a sculptor if I’ve made a goose from plasticine with my kid? Would I become one after taking a few courses or only after my first local exhibition? Clarity is not expected here.
I remember reading a book about free diving and scientists who dedicated their lives to researching whales in the Gulf of Mexico, swimming alongside these creatures and sharks in the ocean. I was so immersed in the story, imagining myself there and then dream appeared - whales.
It’s not clear if that dream is about learning how to free dive, researching whales, or simply swimming in the ocean in general. However, since that day, I’ve started to spend more time in open water, and it has become an environment that draws me in.
Don’t dismiss a dream if it’s unclear. If your friend showed you his new car, and you were fascinated by the way the engine looked, write it down: car, engine, where is the engine in an electric car? or any word, phrase, or question that will bring you back to that experience. It was something that created an emotional reaction; there is something interesting hidden there that’s worth digging.
Things will become clear afterward, often in unexpected ways. You may start with an abstract idea like typewriter and then, half a year later, find yourself spending your summer vacation in a distant mountain cabin, writing the first draft of your book.

Ask any ultra runner in the race, and you’ll find that no one actually runs the full distance. Experiencing the suffering and pain, which are constant companions in ultras, and keeping in mind that it will last for another 20 or 30 hours, is a crushing feeling that can break even the strongest.
What athletes do instead is split the race into multiple smaller parts and concentrate their thoughts only on the current stage. When you reach a checkpoint, you pat yourself on the back, say Great job I've done here! and choose the next checkpoint and run towards that.
There are two requirements that a checkpoint must satisfy to work:
	1	It has to be meaningful and require effort to reach. Setting the next checkpoint just 5 minutes from the last is too easy and wouldn’t create a sense of achievement that gives us strength and a motivation boost
	2	It has to be clear when we reach it, but it’s expected to be unclear how to reach it. A checkpoint could be on top of a mountain, but you have no idea how to climb there with such tired legs.
Think what could be the next checkpoint for your dream?</Text>

            <Title>Disappointment</Title>
            <Text>Software engineers know the feeling well. You work in a team on a complex app, open a source code file that’s six months old, and are stunned by disgust - the source code is ugly, the choice of technologies is inappropriate, and assumptions about the business domain are wrong. You wonder who made such a mess, only to realize that it was written by you.

This happens all the time. It doesn’t matter if you’re an experienced engineer or a junior who has just started a career. It’s a crushing feeling of shame and disappointment, but only for the first few hundred times. It happens so often that eventually, you get used to it and accept that it’s natural.

It happens because we grow. We learn new best practices for using a programming language, gain more experience in understanding the nuances of how businesses operate, and when it’s appropriate or not to use certain technologies. Half a year ago, you did your best, but now you are better, so the past results look unsatisfying.

Looking back and seeing results that disappoint you is a sign of growth. It’s a sign that you are better now.

When working on the first draft of this book, I always move forward - I write a chapter and switch to the next one without looking back. Editing, rewriting, and restructuring will happen later, once most of the book is written. A few days ago, I opened one of the first pages that I’ve wrote, which is around half a year old. It looked so ugly that my first thought was to abandon writing completely and bury the memories of ever having done such a miserable thing.

I’m glad that I didn’t like those pages. In fact, if writing from half a year ago looked fine, it would mean that I hadn’t grown as a writer since I started writing this book. It’s my first book, I was not a writer when I began it. The feeling of disappointment when looking at the first pages gives me hope that I’m slowly becoming one.

As we grow, our expectations of ourselves also grow. When you start sculpting, it’s about form and mass - you create sculptures of humans, animals, monsters, or other objects and are satisfied if the result looks convincing enough. As you become better, you start to expect that your sculptures will convey a certain feeling, express an idea, or, even though static, represent a movement or a change. It’s no longer just about sculpting a human, but creating a sculpture that represents greed, passion, despair, or something else. Growing expectations can lead to disappointment when we fail to achieve them.

Remember that with growing expectations of yourself, you are going into uncharted territory, and it’s expected to fail at first. With painting, you may learn how important contrast is, notice mistakes in your past works, and expect to improve them in new ones, but still fall to completely solving them. With sculpture, you now know that people look at the eyes first in a human sculpture and expect them to convey a certain mood, but fail to do so first few times.

The disappointment of failing to meet your own expectations should not bring you down. Look back and see that you’ve increased the difficulty. You are expecting much more from yourself than before, and failing to meet these expectations is not exactly a failure but a sign of your striving to become better.

Coming in last in a school race and then finishing last in country wide competitions may seem like two failures, but the expectations and so is difficulty are so different that it’s hardly so.</Text>

            <Title>Pacing</Title>
            <Text>If you begin running at a speed that you cannot maintain throughout the entire race, you will hit a wall before reaching the finish line. You’ll feel a fire in your lungs, and your legs will be consumed by pain. In running, burning out is explicit and, in a sense, quite literal.

Mastery takes decades to reach, and correct pacing protects us from burning out and stopping in the middle. We are all capable of sprinting—maintaining a high speed for a short time that is followed by a complete body collapse and the need for recovery. You uncover the beauty and novelty of a new skill; you dedicate every evening to it, only to grow tired and fed up with it after a few weeks or months.

Correct pacing is difficult to find and only comes through the experience of failures resulting from choosing incorrectly. Opting for a pace that is too fast is a common mistake that can occur among both novice learners and more advanced scholars.

If you’re feeling demotivated and have lost interest in a skill - slow down or take a break. Reflect on the amount of time you’ve practiced that skill in the last week/month/year, and compare it to previous periods. If you’ve spent 30 hours on your favourite musical instrument this month, but typically it’s 20 hours, it’s not surprising that you’re feeling tired. If you usually write for 1 hour per day, but suddenly find yourself immersed for 3 hours, the next day’s writing might seem unappealing, and it’s going to be hard to find the motivation to write even a few sentences. Instead of getting upset or feeling guilty about a sudden break, accept it – you’ve been moving too fast and need to slow down.

Run too slow and guilt will be running along. You used to write 10 pages per day, but now found time to write 10 pages in a whole week. You’ve visited gym 3 times a week, this week you hit only once. In all those cases, we would feel guilt: not doing what we’re supposed to, progressing slowly, and not giving our all.

Accept it - it’s part of the life and no one goes without such obstacles and drops. Every week is a new, and every Monday start it all over again. Start it from the scratch without weight of the past - it doesn’t matter how little you do week before, you only have this week.

Allow yourself to start over.</Text>

            <Title>Accountability</Title>
            <Text>Reaching mastery is your own personal journey—you are the only one who wants it, the only one who can achieve it, and the only one responsible for it. Be honest with yourself. If you dream of learning how to fly a plane but have done absolutely nothing towards it over a year, then it’s a decision you’ve made. You are in charge of the entire process, and every decision (or lack thereof) is yours and yours alone. Don’t lie to yourself - every day is filled with choices and you are the only one who is choosing.

Accountability means honesty. If the plan was to hit the gym three times a week, but in reality, you hardly visit it weekly, then be honest—you visit the gym once a week. There are always obstacles; there’s always a lack of time. Sometimes, however, you can certainly recall when you found a solution: you woke up earlier, you compromised, and you found a way through. Other times, you didn’t even try and accepted whatever was given to you. In all those cases, you are the one who made these choices; you are the one who is responsible for the consequences.

Accountability is also about measurement—how many times you went for a run, how many sculptures you’ve completed, how many words you wrote. The point of measurement is not to find a perfect metric but to reduce uncertainty—to have something to track that is close to reality. Following the time you’ve spent on skill practice is far from being ideal, but it’s okay for indicating how well or poorly we were at learning.</Text>

            <Title>Fear</Title>
            <Text>For years, I’ve dreamt about the sky, yet every year, I convince myself that it’s not the best time to take any action. There’s no free time or money to enrol in a flying course. Deep down, though, it’s a lie. The real reason that has prevented me from starting is fear.

A few years ago, to satisfy my longing for flying, I got a Microsoft Flight Simulator. As the name implies, it’s not a game but a simulator with realistic physics and models of actual aircraft. I opted for a glider, an aircraft without an engine that takes off by being towed into the air by another plane. After detachment, it glides through the sky, supported by the natural air flows.

I did it for fun and without reading or preparing myself, so I randomly began pressing buttons and somehow managed to lift off. It wasn’t a big surprise that after a few seconds, I crashed, and the game ended. It was just a game, but a sudden realisation dawned on me that failure in real-life flying could result in death.

In sports, art, music, writing, or even software engineering, mistakes are natural and part of the process. They cannot be fully prevented, and making mistakes and recovering from them is a way of improving. Failures may be discouraging, and despite how we feel about them, it’s not the end of the world situation. However, that evening in flying, I understood that failure could actually mean the end of it.

Being scared of getting hurt or dying can stop us from starting things like flying a plane, trying parachute jumping, doing combat sports, exploring free diving, or sailing alone across the ocean.

Dealing with these fears is best approached through education and knowledge. Anything related to the sky, like piloting or skydiving, follows strict safety standards. Beginner combat courses concentrate on developing foundational skills and techniques in a fully controlled environment - don’t be afraid of sparring on the very first day. Exploring information about your chosen activity will show that the real risks are low, and it might seem more intimidating than it actually is. The fears you have are well-known, so as solutions and workarounds that minimise your exposure to such risks.

Don’t let fear block your rational thinking. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a widely used move is the german suplex where a wrestler grabs their opponent around the waist from behind and throws them over their shoulder to the mat. I’ve wanted to try this sport for many years, but one day I read about a guy who broke his back after such a move. I decided that it’s not worth the risk and gave up on my dream before even trying.

Keep in mind that injuries are possible in any sport, and certain injuries can be quite serious and even fatal. But it’s important to be sensible and remember that the chance of these things occurring is rather low - research your fears, and often you realize that they have no basis or reasons to exist.

For some, the thought of swimming in the ocean causes fear, and many avoid anything related to it due to the fear of being eaten by sharks. Although sharks are real, this fear lacks a rational basis. On the entire planet, there are only around 10 deaths from shark attacks per year, making the likelihood of such an incident 10,000 times lower than the risks associated with everyday driving.

Reducing the feeling of fear can be achieved through gradual exposure and training. In free diving, you hold your breath for minutes while descending deep into the water. One of the main fears is the risk of blackout - holding your breath for too long can lead to oxygen deprivation, causing unconsciousness, which can be fatal when you’re in the water. Enrol in a free diving course in your swimming pool, surrounded by swimmers, lifeguards, and trainers. This provides a safe environment to explore the sport, understand your body’s reactions, which is essential for this activity.

Fear of physical harm is clear and explicit - we are all afraid of death, afraid of pain and suffering. There is nothing wrong with being afraid, but the next time you postpone realising your dream because of such fear, just stop and learn about the actual risks and common solutions. Once you’re educated, you’ll find that slowly exposing yourself to the new exciting world isn’t actually that scary. There are thousands or even millions of people in the world who are doing it, and so can you.

It’s much harder to deal with fears that are not about physical pain.

Every day, life presents us with new opportunities - sometimes in the form of new problems that we need to solve; other times, we have multiple choices and need to make decisions; or sometimes, we are lucky to unexpectedly stumble upon a chance to change our lives. Frequently, we don’t even notice new possibilities, but much more often, we choose to ignore them and pretend they don’t exist. Life is constantly presenting us with new paths, but we keep deciding not to follow it. Deep down, we want to chase new opportunities, explore them, realize our desires, and change our lives, but we don’t because of fear - fear of failure.

How to fight such fear? First of all, by failing more. Start writing a book if you’ve never done it before - every sentence will be a disaster that will keep reminding you that starting to write a book was a mistake. Do sports, which is nothing but an infinite stream of wins and losses. With art or music, eventually, you’ll start treating failures as happy accidents. Making mistakes while doing those activities will make you more failure-tolerant; it will help you realize that it’s possible to make mistakes and move forward simultaneously. And one day, you’ll realize that moving forward without making mistakes is not actually possible. It should be enough to make yourself not afraid of making mistakes in isolation; it’s easy to mess up when no one is looking, but the fear of failing in front of others may still paralyse you. What to do about those?

Many writers have a tradition of collecting rejection letters from publishers, often choosing to proudly display them by sticking them to a wall or affixing them to the fridge door. One might wonder why anyone would think it’s a good idea to keep their own mistakes highlighted and visible in front of them all the time? Shouldn’t we all try to forget our mistakes as soon as possible to avoid reliving the nightmare experience of shame and embarrassment all over again? Is this a kind of self-torture that writers sadistically enjoy?

In the publishing world, rejection is common, and even experienced writers continually receive rejections from publishers. It’s a cruel reality where writers may invest years in writing a book, only to receive a collection of rejections from different publishers in return. Even the most dedicated and mentally tough writers may start considering abandoning their craft under the pressure of such failures. We are not empowered to change this reality, but we can make such failures less devastating by accepting them. And accepting them is to normalise them.

Printing out all the failures and placing them where they are visible normalises rejection. It’s not the first time, and for sure, it’s not the last time. It prompts us to acknowledge it openly and be ready for it. Knowing that there is a high chance of rejection makes us more resilient in the face of failure; it’s not the end of the world, but simply means we didn’t win this time.

A collection of rejections wouldn’t become a corner of depression and a graveyard of dead hopes. Instead, it may become your main motivator and a force that pulls you forward when you’re feeling down. The only writers who don’t have those are the ones who never send drafts to publishers - but you did. Every time you try something in your life, you have a chance to fail, and by trying more, you’re going to fail more. All those rejections are signs of growth, signs of trying. Every rejection is attempt that you’ve embraced.

Having rejections in front of us makes it much easier to deal with new failures. A few days ago, I wrote a cover letter for an open position that I was really interested in. A few hours after sending the letter, I discovered that I had made 3 mistakes in the word professional. I haven’t received any reply yet, probably because I failed to convince them of my professionalism. The only reason I didn’t die from embarrassment that day is that a week before that, I failed on an even bigger scale in an interview with another company.

Having a list of our failures makes us more humble. It cures the disease of perfectionism by reminding us that we are human beings. It helps us adopt a lighthearted perspective and not take things too personally. Having a list close by makes us more free to try new things - failure doesn’t look so dramatic anymore, so why not dive deep into new opportunities and pursue the chances that life has given us? Yes, we may fail, so what? It’s just another rejection letter to be stuck to the wall.

Avoid focusing on the end result. Worst thing that I’ve ever did with sculpting was fixating my mind on the idea of what I’m trying to sculpt. There is a difference between visualisation, which is powerful mental technique that we can use to enhance your performance, and wishful thinking about the desired outcome.

Athletes use visualisation, also known as imagery, to cultivate the right state of mind before the competition or a hard training. Idea is that you imagine how you going to perform with all the details, trying to sense the movement, the concrete steps. You imagine the feelings that you’ll go through - feeling of an energy at the start, your muscles full of strength and then fatigue at the end, pain, shortness of breath and your mental toughness that will allow you to persist even in the case of great suffering.

Even if you imagine things, idea is to stay realistic - you don’t imagine that marathon running to be easy, but dive into thoughts about what you may encounter, what problems you are going to face and imagine how you’ll respond to each of that. Main focus is the process itself, your feeling and reaction to that. It’s a great technique that can help you with many things from public speaking to musical performance and sport, but make a few steps a side and instead of helping you’ll summon a monster that will prevent you from achieving anything in life.

Fantasising, although sounds harmless, is a dangerous practice. On a surface it has a lot of common with visualisation - both are about imagining future things, but fantasising is a wishful thinking with the focus on the result rather than a process. It’s about immediate gratification - you are purchasing first running shoes and imagine yourself crossing a finish line of your first marathon. You see yourself excited, finishing strong with a great smile, you’ve done it, you are now a runner.

Fantasies like that are about comfort, perfect and effortless execution and then when facing a real life, which is an opposite of our fantasies, we will feel crashed and give up. In fact with such fantasising we are unlikely to even start - in our mind we’ve crossed a marathon finish line already, so why bother to train for that? Fantasies are unrealistic and perfect. Striving for perfection is not a good quality that should be mentioned on the job interview, but a curse that can leave our life in ruins.

We are afraid of failures because we want to be perfect. And we know that we are not.

Sometimes it’s socially prescribed perfectionism: others won’t accept, value, or love us unless we are perfect. Other time it’s a coping mechanism of how we deal with stress in other part of our life: Perfect execution in the training or practice session gives you the sense of control in life where control seems lost.

In modern time perfectionism caused by being under the pressure of the social perception. We are surrounded by high achievers, images of top performers and artificial and fake perfection. You can’t spend a day without being exposed to accomplishment by others. It seems like everyone already become perfect in improving their life everyday and so we have to participate in this race as well.

When people are asked what they regret about their lives, seldom do their answers involve things they did. Instead, they regret things they didn’t do - missing opportunities, hesitating, or being indecisive. Now, look at your choices, at the opportunities that surround you, at the paths that you hesitate to follow, and imagine yourself in 30 years. Imagine yourself much older, looking back on your life, remembering today as a day of the past when the younger you was afraid to make a change. Would you regret not following the opportunities lying in front of you? Would you regret that you never tried?</Text>

            <Text>Non-runners have trouble understanding how someone can enjoy a 3-hour run without getting bored. Those who don’t read cannot comprehend how someone can be excited about holding a new 800-page book; it may appear rather dull and intimidating. Classical music may look uninteresting, and it’s challenging to grasp how others can enjoy it.

Interest comes from understanding nuances - from the little details that are invisible to outsiders but bring joy to those who can see them.

Every sculpture begins with a piece of clay in your hand, but you may find yourself delving deep into human anatomy, holding a human atlas, and discovering the complexity of our ears. Drumming might start as a fun way to hit things with sticks, then learning about double pedal techniques and realising that legs has to be developed as well as your arms.

In learning new skills, we constantly discover these nuances and can learn and practice them. This makes each practice session different and interesting. It slightly shifts the direction of our learning and creates novelty. To outsiders, it may seem like we’re doing the same thing, but for us, it’s an entirely new world where everything is new and exciting. To stay engaged, embrace the nuances of your craft and dive deep into every small detail.

Change direction and explore new possibilities. Do crazy things because they’re incredibly fun. Read about how the old masters practiced their crafts and do it like in ancient times - run barefoot, sculpt with clay by the lake’s shore, put your sticks aways and play on a hand drum. Or embrace the future by trying out air drumming, digital sculpture, or indoor virtual running.

Maintain novelty by going outside your craft to gain better support for it. Learn music theory if you’re a drummer, learn painting if you’re a sculptor, or learn sculpture if you’re an artist. This enables you to gain a different perspective, view your craft from a new angle, and discover previously invisible nuances.

Many ultra running races take place in beautiful locations, where runners enjoy the sights of forests, mountains, waterfalls or deserts. One day I discovered a different kind of challenge: the 24-hour races that happens on a 400-meter running track. In these races, runners complete hundreds of loops, over and over again, beginning in the morning, running throughout the day, and continuing through the night until the sun rises again.

I decided to run a 50 km race on a running track to see if I get insane or dizzy because of all this circular motion. I spent a month training on the track to get used to that. To make it more fun, I chose to do the run at midnight on a Friday. The run went well, expectedly I was completely exhausted by the end and could barely walk. When I was coming back home I realised that it feels like I’m 20 years again - coming home after a Friday night party and having troubles walking straight. This unique experience will stay with me forever and so as love for running.

Embrace the nuances, learn and change every small detail of your craft and you will never be bored.</Text>

            <Title>Resilience</Title>
            <Text>Before we begin learning a new skill, we imagine the kind of challenges we will face and mentally prepare ourselves for them. When we start to write, we expect writer’s block to come, but we are determined to push through it. When we decide to run a marathon, we assume that fatigue will be the biggest challenge and promise ourselves never to give up. As we start to learn sculpting, we anticipate that the hardest part will be paying attention to every small detail and prepare ourselves for the tedious yet undoubtedly rewarding work.

When those challenges come our way, we are mentally prepared to face them. This doesn’t make it easy, but expecting them and having time to prepare makes us feel that everything is under our control and goes according to the plan.

The same applies to the challenges we’ve already encountered in the past. They might be tough, but we’ve solved them before and can tackle them today. If you’ve been running a specific trail many times with a challenging hill in the middle, past successful experiences will help you conquer it again. Confidence comes from past accomplishments. We know that even if it feels impossible to complete, we can overcome it, just as we’ve done before.

Facing and completing a tough, but expected challenge is not resilience. Resilience is facing the unexpected and overcoming it.

Running an ultra and feeling permanently fatigued after tens of hours is challenging and expected. But what would you do if the run starts with a huge mountain climb, and you feel crushed after just one hour in? Are you going to give up?

When learning the drums, you start with easy beats, get used to struggling for a while, but then become able to play them after half an hour of practice. But how would you feel when learning a popular metal song and making no progress for days? Would you abandon your effort?

Being a writer, writing a book, and dedicating months of your life to it, what would happen if one day you find an already written book similar to yours? Is this the end of it?

Unexpected challenges are part of the journey, and it’s not a question of if they will come, but rather when. Issues, failures, rejections, mistakes, and crushed hopes are a natural part of it - accept them as a part of the path. Acceptance enables us to move forward - to forget the past and embrace a new reality.

Once you’ve accepted a new reality, analyse the situation and create a new plan by focusing on your end goal. Running an ultra is a manifestation of mind power over the body, and having crushed legs after one hour of running doesn’t change much - you came for the challenge, and the mountain has indeed delivered one. If you want to become a writer, then finding a book similar to your draft is hardly the end of the world. Writers rewrite books, so you can too; writers write many books, so you’re capable of doing it as well.

Accepting the new unexpected challenges that your journey has presented to you is a way for us to grow.

By accepting and embracing new unexpected challenges, we learn to become mentally tougher. Mental toughness is how we cope with crises; it’s about regaining a sense of control and not allowing fear and anxiety to overwhelm us and take control of our lives. It enables us to remain functional in adverse situations. It’s not a skill we are born with, but one that is developed whenever we face the unexpected.

Mastery is a long journey filled with unexpected adverse events, and mental toughness is required to overcome the obstacles you will face. The irony is that mental toughness can only be developed by facing challenges. Every time you encounter an unexpected challenge, remember - it’s your chance to become tougher, and being tougher means being more prepared for even bigger challenges.</Text>

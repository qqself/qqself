<p class="itemTitle">Preface</p>
<p class="itemText">There are many books about mastery, but whenever I read a story about a gifted child who has been passionate about music since they were 5 years old, a part of me dies. When you read interviews with masters, it’s as if they are from a different dimension: doing it their whole life, constantly motivated, always improving, willing to sacrifice everything not related to their craft.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Dream</p>
<p class="itemText">It was 5 minutes before the midnight, I was waiting on a start line on my very first 100 km ultra running marathon. At the start of the race, everyone is nervous and excited about the adventure that lies in front of them. I was standing there in the crowd, feeling motivated to show my best, experiencing fear about what awaits me, and full of doubt about whether I can actually do it or not.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Discovery</p>
<p class="itemText">There are millions of fulfilling activities that you can start doing, which will bring passion and meaning to your life. It’s there, waiting for you, but you cannot start doing it until you know that it exists first. Most likely, all the things you’ve already discovered in your life happened by themselves - a random video, book, or article that got you interested in a new hobby; a friend mentioned something, or parents drove you to try new things. Discovery is a product of chance and luck, but t...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">What comes after dream?</p>
<p class="itemText">A dream is a vague idea, often lacking a clear first step and a concrete final destination. It’s like a blurry vision where you see yourself in a spacesuit working on the Moon or sitting in a chair in your studio, writing a book. Dreams are expected to be unclear and idealistic views of the new you.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to become a sculptor is a dream. It’s fine that there is no clear way to start, and it’s also okay that there is no concrete destination. Am I already a sculptor if I’ve made a goose from plas...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Starting</p>
<p class="itemText">When you start a new endeavour, like learning to play the piano, you are only truly learning when you practice. It’s only when you run that you become better at it. It’s only when you sculpt that you become a sculptor.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Listening to how other people play, watching others explain how to sculpt, or reading articles on getting started with running has no effect on your skill. You only make progress when you practice. All tutorials, lectures, books, and learning videos have no direct effect on your ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Expectations</p>
<p class="itemText">There is an adrenaline rush when you first go through the doors of the gym or a painting studio. The excitement before leaving home for your first run, or that majestic feeling when you unbox your first guitar. The very first drum set I received was for Christmas, and I spent the whole night assembling it. When I was finished at 2 AM, even though I was afraid of waking up my wife and kids, I couldn’t resist making a gentle hit. I heard a sound, and it felt magical.</span></p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Identities</p>
<p class="itemText">If you Google How to write a book? you’ll find a lot of great articles from established authors with many helpful advices. Before starting to write, you have to think about the main topic of your book, imagine your audience, create an outline, and then, even before you write an opening, the common advice is to start calling yourself a writer. It sounds silly and premature, but it actually helps.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Difficulty</p>
<p class="itemText">Training plans for runners consist of microcycles. You start with low intensity and smaller volumes, then the following week is slightly harder, and in the third week, you have to do a lot of high-intensity training with high volumes. The week after is for recovery, where intensity is very low, and volumes are smaller. Such cycles allow your body to adapt to the stress and slowly build up fitness. They also allow you to mix easy and difficult training sessions.</span></p></p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Progress</p>
<p class="itemText">Feeling of progress is the main motivator in skill learning. You become better, unlock things that were not possible before, and see the results of your practice and training. When progress is invisible, it’s hard to continue putting effort into learning.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some skills, the hardest part is the beginning. With musical instruments, at first, you’ll be making sounds instead of music. Going to the gym in the first few months will result in muscle pain rather than muscle growth. Pursuing art will y...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Recovery</p>
<p class="itemText">Many know how to rest, but few know how to recover. To keep moving and getting better day after day, year after year we have to learn how to recover.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rest means not doing an activity, while recovery means doing something that help us get energy back and be ready to practice again. Lying on a sofa is a rest, but it’s not really recovering. Actually, just lying on a sofa can be a way to recover, and it’s actually quite difficult to do – just lying there without holding a phone or watching TV.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Consumption</p>
<p class="itemText">If you decide to watch all getting started for runners videos, you’ll die before you go for a first run. You can find an answer on any question you have and this is what we, as a humanity, have gifted to ourselves. You can explore new skills, get inspired, find instructions, training plans or race reports. Lack of information is not a problem anymore - we can find information about any skill and start learning it from any point in the world.</span></p></p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Pacing</p>
<p class="itemText">If you begin running at a speed that you cannot maintain throughout the entire race, you will hit a wall before reaching the finish line. You’ll feel a fire in your lungs, and your legs will be consumed by pain. In running, burning out is explicit and, in a sense, quite literal.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mastery takes decades to reach, and correct pacing protects us from burning out and stopping in the middle. We are all capable of sprinting—maintaining a high speed for a short time that is followed by a complete body c...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Accountability</p>
<p class="itemText">Reaching mastery is your own personal journey—you are the only one who wants it, the only one who can achieve it, and the only one responsible for it. Be honest with yourself. If you dream of learning how to fly a plane but have done absolutely nothing towards it over a year, then it’s a decision you’ve made. You are in charge of the entire process, and every decision (or lack thereof) is yours and yours alone. Don’t lie to yourself - every day is filled with choices and you are the only one who...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Perfect week</p>
<p class="itemText">It’s Sunday evening, and I’m sitting on a couch, thinking about the upcoming week - what I plan to achieve and how much time I need to spend on practicing different skills. I have an idea about a certain amount of hours that have to be spent every week to progress, and I aim for that number every week.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all have those numbers - how many times we should visit the gym, the minimum number of pages we need to write to meet a deadline, or the number of exercises that should be practiced with a mus...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Treats</p>
<p class="itemText">Ultra running is physically tough, but the main battle is mental - you need to keep going no matter how bad you feel. Anything that can ease the mental pressure is worth using. One such thing is to carry a treat - something that you enjoy eating - and use it at the right moment. It may sound like a small and unimportant detail, but sometimes even the slightest support is what we need to be able to continue.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Getting back</p>
<p class="itemText">Before my first ultramarathon, I thought the main thing was to keep running and reach the finish line as fast as I could. It turns out that on longer distances and complex terrains, it’s impossible to run all the time. People switch to walking, and some spend most of their time slowly but steadily moving toward the finish line.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">On my first 100km race, I was able to run for only 5 hours, followed by another 19 hours of slow walking until I reached the finish line. That day, I became convinced th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Enjoy nuances</p>
<p class="itemText">Non-runners have trouble understanding how someone can enjoy a 3-hour run without getting bored. Those who don’t read cannot comprehend how someone can be excited about holding a new 800-page book; it may appear rather dull and intimidating. Classical music may look uninteresting, and it’s challenging to grasp how others can enjoy it.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Interest comes from understanding nuances - from the little details that are invisible to outsiders but bring joy to those who can see them.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Comparison</p>
<p class="itemText">I had lunch with two of my new colleagues, and it turns out both of them are into triathlon. As a runner myself, I became curious about how they train. Turns out neither of them has a training plan and they exercise in a rather chaotic manner, squeezing training into their hectic daily lives with a few hours of training per week. Later on, I realised that both of them are much faster at running than me. Considering that the running stage comes last after hours of swimming and biking, my enduranc...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Lack of time</p>
<p class="itemText">I’m in the cafe. In front of me, there is an old gentleman reading a newspaper; he doesn’t seem to be in a hurry. Besides me, there are a bunch of young girls laughing loudly and enjoying their time together - they also don’t seem worried about the passing time. I’m sitting here, writing these lines, simultaneously stressed about the lack of time and anxious that the time I was given is going to waste.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Capabilities</p>
<p class="itemText">The goal of learning and practicing is to expand our capabilities, allowing us to do something we cannot do now. It’s a transformation we undergo: we choose something that seems impossible, and then, through hard work, we make it achievable. Every time we become capable of something new, we open a door that leads us to a world that was previously locked. It is a reward that keeps us motivated to continue practicing.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Too easy - no progress</p>
<p class="itemText"></span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we start learning a new skill, we struggle with everything: in writing, words don’t come out; in running, we can’t keep our breath; in drumming, we fail to use our hands and legs independently. Even though it feels tough, such discomfort and struggle are indicators of learning.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the beginning, every minute you spend practicing a skill will make you better. The body responds to training by adapting to the stress placed on it; your brain forms new neural connections. When we take our firs...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Replan</p>
<p class="itemText">It works nicely in movies - you see a hero who is dedicated to winning no matter what: all the obstacles are ignored, all the promises are kept, and even a thunderstorm outside cannot prevent the hero from training. Above everything else, there is a plan that the main hero is following until success is reached.</span></p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Approaching challenges</p>
<p class="itemText">When the running race starts, it’s straightforward. You’ve been training and practicing, preparing for this moment, and now it’s time for the performance. It’s a big show where you demonstrate to others and yourself everything that you’ve learned. Races are about execution; you put in all the effort in the hope of proving to yourself what you are capable of. But the challenge starts even before the race starts.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Feeling Of Control</p>
<p class="itemText">I was doing a 70 km solo run in October in Finland. It was a cold autumn day, and all the trails were covered with water. For most of the distance, I was walking knee-deep in the cold water. I slipped on a fallen log while trying to cross a running stream, fell down, and went fully under the freezing water. During the day, I was fine, but when night came, I broke down.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Disappointment</p>
<p class="itemText">Software engineers know the feeling well. You work in a team on a complex app, open a source code file that’s six months old, and are stunned by disgust - the source code is ugly, the choice of technologies is inappropriate, and assumptions about the business domain are wrong. You wonder who made such a mess, only to realize that it was written by you.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This happens all the time. It doesn’t matter if you’re an experienced engineer or a junior who has just started a career. It’s a crushing feelin...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Environment</p>
<p class="itemText">The environment defines our mood. If you’ve just woken up, lying in your bed and thinking you’re not in the mood for the gym, remember that a warm bed environment is primarily for rest, and your mood would align with that.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get in the mood for working out, you need to change your environment first.

<p class="itemTitle">Resilience</p>
<p class="itemText">Before we begin learning a new skill, we imagine the kind of challenges we will face and mentally prepare ourselves for them. When we start to write, we expect writer’s block to come, but we are determined to push through it. When we decide to run a marathon, we assume that fatigue will be the biggest challenge and promise ourselves never to give up. As we start to learn sculpting, we anticipate that the hardest part will be paying attention to every small detail and prepare ourselves for the te...</p>

<p class="itemText">For years, I’ve dreamt about the sky, yet every year, I convince myself that it’s not the best time to take any action. There’s no free time or money to enrol in a flying course. Deep down, though, it’s a lie. The real reason that has prevented me from starting is fear.</span></p></p>
